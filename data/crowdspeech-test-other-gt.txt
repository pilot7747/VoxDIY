https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/0.mp3	franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1.mp3	my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2.mp3	my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/3.mp3	i can scarcely credit it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/4.mp3	then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/5.mp3	shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/6.mp3	so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of may at the same hour in the forenoon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/7.mp3	i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the court yard entirely separated from the main building
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/8.mp3	now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/9.mp3	that depends when do you leave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/10.mp3	for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/11.mp3	then we shall not meet in paris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/12.mp3	i fear i shall not have that honor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/13.mp3	well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/14.mp3	what is the matter asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/15.mp3	i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/16.mp3	did you ever meet him previously to coming hither
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/17.mp3	upon my honor then listen to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/18.mp3	he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/19.mp3	then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/20.mp3	but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/21.mp3	why really the thing seems to me simple enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/22.mp3	talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/23.mp3	certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/24.mp3	my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/25.mp3	what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/26.mp3	i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/27.mp3	and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/28.mp3	well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/29.mp3	and now my dear franz let us talk of something else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/30.mp3	they're done for said the schoolmaster in a low key to the chouette out with your vitriol and mind your eye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/31.mp3	the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/32.mp3	by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/33.mp3	sarah and her brother having again passed by the tapis franc arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its opened cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/34.mp3	in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seyton with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/35.mp3	no said the old brute grumblingly no not one ring what a shame
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/36.mp3	tom seyton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/37.mp3	oh ah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/38.mp3	then addressing thomas seyton you know the plain of saint denis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/39.mp3	did you see in the cabaret we have just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/40.mp3	cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/41.mp3	wretch i do not seek his life replied sarah to the schoolmaster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/42.mp3	let's go and meet him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/43.mp3	old boy it will pay for looking after
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/44.mp3	well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and i shall see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/45.mp3	in the plain of saint denis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/46.mp3	between saint ouen and the road of la revolte at the end of the road agreed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/47.mp3	he had forgotten the address of the self styled fan painter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/48.mp3	the fiacre started
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/49.mp3	then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge's door and which merits a particular description
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/50.mp3	shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/51.mp3	at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chasseur also
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/52.mp3	wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/53.mp3	very well at half past ten
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/54.mp3	is the countess up yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/55.mp3	the valet left the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/56.mp3	good morning lucien good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/57.mp3	you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/58.mp3	no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/59.mp3	yes he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles seven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/60.mp3	it is for that reason you see me so early
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/61.mp3	i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/62.mp3	peste i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/63.mp3	besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/64.mp3	about what about the papers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/65.mp3	in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/66.mp3	they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/67.mp3	come come that is not bad said lucien
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/68.mp3	with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/69.mp3	unfortunately there could be no doubt or misconception as to platterbaff's guilt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/70.mp3	he had not only pleaded guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was busy examining a small model of the free trade hall in manchester
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/71.mp3	the jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/72.mp3	of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the government's point of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/73.mp3	a headlong pardon on the eve of a bye election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even delayed would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/74.mp3	hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in whitehall and downing street and other affected centres
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/75.mp3	the jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a deathlike hush
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/76.mp3	the foreman delivered his message
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/77.mp3	the jury find the prisoner guilty of blowing up the albert hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/78.mp3	the jury wish to add a rider drawing attention to the fact that a by election is pending in the parliamentary division of nemesis on hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/79.mp3	and may the lord have mercy on the poll a junior counsel exclaimed irreverently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/80.mp3	fifteen hundred said the prime minister with a shudder it's too horrible to think of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/81.mp3	our majority last time was only a thousand and seven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/82.mp3	seven thirty amended the prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/83.mp3	not later than seven thirty then said the chief organiser i have promised the agent down there that he shall be able to display posters announcing platterbaff is out before the poll opens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/84.mp3	he said it was our only chance of getting a telegram radprop is in to night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/85.mp3	despite the earliness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing trelawney refrain of the fifteen hundred voting men came in a steady monotonous chant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/86.mp3	he exclaimed won't go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/87.mp3	he says he never has left prison without a brass band to play him out and he's not going to go without one now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/88.mp3	said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply a released prisoner with a brass band how on earth could we defend it on the estimates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/89.mp3	anyway he won't go unless he has a band
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/90.mp3	poll opens in five minutes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/91.mp3	is platterbaff out yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/92.mp3	in heaven's name why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/93.mp3	the chief organiser rang off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/94.mp3	this is not a moment for standing on dignity he observed bluntly musicians must be supplied at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/95.mp3	can't you get a strike permit asked the organiser
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/96.mp3	i'll try said the home secretary and went to the telephone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/97.mp3	eight o'clock struck the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound will vote the other way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/98.mp3	a telegram was brought in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/99.mp3	it was from the central committee rooms at nemesis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/100.mp3	without a band he would not go and they had no band
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/101.mp3	a quarter past ten half past
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/102.mp3	have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/103.mp3	demanded the chief organiser of the prison governor drums cymbals those sort of things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/104.mp3	the warders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow the men themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/105.mp3	lend us the instruments said the chief organiser
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/106.mp3	the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moment's reflection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/107.mp3	it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it to the improvised strains of i didn't want to do it the prisoner strode forth to freedom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/108.mp3	the word of the song had reference it was understood to the incarcerating government and not to the destroyer of the albert hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/109.mp3	the seat was lost after all by a narrow majority
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/110.mp3	the local trade unionists took offence at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike breakers and even the release of platterbaff failed to pacify them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/111.mp3	with that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/112.mp3	well the failing still exists doesn't it said her husband or do you suppose a reform of character is entailed along with the estate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/113.mp3	besides cynicism apart his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/114.mp3	when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well to do all suspicion of sordid motive naturally disappears the thing becomes merely a tiresome malady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/115.mp3	wilfrid pigeoncote had suddenly become heir to his uncle sir wilfrid pigeoncote on the death of his cousin major wilfrid pigeoncote who had succumbed to the after effects of a polo accident
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/116.mp3	a wilfrid pigeoncote had covered himself with honours in the course of marlborough's campaigns and the name wilfrid had been a baptismal weakness in the family ever since the new heir to the family dignity and estates was a young man of about five and twenty who was known more by reputation than by person to a wide circle of cousins and kinsfolk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/117.mp3	and the reputation was an unpleasant one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/118.mp3	from his late schooldays onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania he had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/119.mp3	the search usually produced a large and varied yield this is funny said peter pigeoncote to his wife some half hour after their conversation here's a telegram from wilfrid saying he's passing through here in his motor and would like to stop and pay us his respects
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/120.mp3	signed wilfrid pigeoncote
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/121.mp3	i suppose he's bringing us a present for the silver wedding good gracious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/122.mp3	the talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/123.mp3	in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/124.mp3	oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents said missus peter suddenly as though struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/125.mp3	such nice useful gifts a few duplicates of course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/126.mp3	seven cream jugs put in peter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/127.mp3	we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/128.mp3	of course some of them can be changed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/129.mp3	i put it down by the claret jug said wilfrid busy with another object
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/130.mp3	vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/131.mp3	after they had said good night to their visitor missus peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/132.mp3	how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a present and i'm hanged if he shall carry one off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/133.mp3	it's the only thing to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/134.mp3	wilfrid was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/135.mp3	it's an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/136.mp3	it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/137.mp3	i should have given it to you last night after dinner only it happened to be a cream jug and you seemed annoyed at having so many duplicates so i felt rather awkward about giving you another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/138.mp3	the snatcher had been an orphan these many years

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/140.mp3	husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/141.mp3	it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/142.mp3	she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/143.mp3	the pigeoncotes had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/144.mp3	peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/145.mp3	missus peter turned to her guest with confidential coyness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/146.mp3	peter's little weakness it runs in the family good lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/147.mp3	do you mean to say he's a kleptomaniac like cousin snatcher
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/148.mp3	brave little woman said peter with a gasp of relief i could never have done it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/149.mp3	when churchyards yawn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/150.mp3	i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car locked in perhaps without water or food

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/153.mp3	out of deference to liddy they washed their dishes once a day and they concocted queer messes according to their several abilities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/154.mp3	miss innes he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room up stairs how are your nerves tonight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/155.mp3	i have none i said happily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/156.mp3	i mean he persisted do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/157.mp3	the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/158.mp3	something is going to occur he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/159.mp3	put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/160.mp3	liddy was sleeping the sleep of the just when i went up stairs and i hunted out my things cautiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/161.mp3	they were talking confidentially together but when i came down they ceased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/162.mp3	there were a few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winters to be instructed as to renewed vigilance and then after extinguishing the hall light we crept in the darkness through the front door and into the night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/163.mp3	i asked no questions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/164.mp3	once only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from doctor stewart when he ran into a wire fence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/165.mp3	i hardly know what i expected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/166.mp3	the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/167.mp3	i confess that just at that minute even sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/168.mp3	in spite of myself i drew my breath in sharply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/169.mp3	it was alex armed with two long handled spades
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/170.mp3	the doctor kept a keen lookout but no one appeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/171.mp3	there's one thing sure i'll not be suspected of complicity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/172.mp3	a doctor is generally supposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging them up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/173.mp3	i held on to him frantically and somehow i got there and looked down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/174.mp3	vain hope i fear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/175.mp3	mister and missus hattersley have been staying at the grove a fortnight and as mister hargrave is still absent and the weather was remarkably fine i never passed a day without seeing my two friends milicent and esther either there or here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/176.mp3	no unless you can tell me when to expect him home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/177.mp3	i can't you don't want him do you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/178.mp3	it is a resolution you ought to have formed long ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/179.mp3	we all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts though we can't respect him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/180.mp3	no i'd rather be like myself bad as i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/181.mp3	never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best of motives
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/182.mp3	but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mister huntingdon or even like yourself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/183.mp3	oh no i couldn't stand that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/184.mp3	fire and fury
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/185.mp3	now don't burst into a tempest at that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/186.mp3	but hang it that's not my fault
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/187.mp3	not years for she's only five and twenty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/188.mp3	what would you make of me and the children to be sure that worry her to death between them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/189.mp3	i know they are bless them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/190.mp3	he followed me into the library
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/191.mp3	i sought out and put into his hands two of milicent's letters one dated from london and written during one of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a lucid interval
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/192.mp3	the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mister grimsby and others insinuating bitter things against mister huntingdon and most ingeniously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on to other men's shoulders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/193.mp3	i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a hearty squeeze but you see if i don't make amends for it d n me if i don't
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/194.mp3	if you intend to reform invoke god's blessing his mercy and his aid not his curse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/195.mp3	god help me then for i'm sure i need it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/196.mp3	where's milicent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/197.mp3	nay not i said he turning her round and pushing her towards me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/198.mp3	milicent flew to thank me overflowing with gratitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/199.mp3	cried she i couldn't have influenced him i'm sure by anything that i could have said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/200.mp3	you never tried me milly said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/201.mp3	after that they will repair to their country home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/202.mp3	it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to where i stood wringing my hands in silent rage and anguish but it's rather long i'll look at it some other time and meanwhile i'll trouble you for your keys my dear what keys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/203.mp3	the keys of your cabinet desk drawers and whatever else you possess said he rising and holding out his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/204.mp3	the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the lock and the others were attached to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/205.mp3	now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/206.mp3	and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/207.mp3	that and all replied the master and the things were cleared away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/208.mp3	mister huntingdon then went up stairs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/209.mp3	muttered he starting back she's the very devil for spite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/210.mp3	i didn't say i'd broken it did i returned he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/211.mp3	i shall put you upon a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses and you needn't trouble yourself any more about my concerns i shall look out for a steward my dear i won't expose you to the temptation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/212.mp3	and as for the household matters missus greaves must be very particular in keeping her accounts we must go upon an entirely new plan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/213.mp3	what great discovery have you made now mister huntingdon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/214.mp3	have i attempted to defraud you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/215.mp3	not in money matters exactly it seems but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/216.mp3	here benson entered with the candles and there followed a brief interval of silence i sitting still in my chair and he standing with his back to the fire silently triumphing in my despair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/217.mp3	i know that day after day such feelings will return upon me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/218.mp3	i try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will cleave to the dust
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/219.mp3	but how am i to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet elapse before they go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/220.mp3	for none could injure me as he has done oh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/221.mp3	the word stares me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate him i hate him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/222.mp3	i sometimes think i ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/223.mp3	i have done well to record them so minutely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/224.mp3	they had betaken themselves to their work i less to divert my mind than to deprecate conversation had provided myself with a book
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/225.mp3	i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and as i am without your talent for dissimulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/226.mp3	upon perusing this she turned scarlet and bit her lip
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/227.mp3	you may go milicent and she'll follow in a while milicent went
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/228.mp3	will you oblige me helen continued she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/229.mp3	ah you are suspicious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/230.mp3	if i were suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infamy long before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/231.mp3	i enjoy a moonlight ramble as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes upon her and the shrubbery happens to be one of my favourite resorts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/232.mp3	she coloured again excessively and remained silent pressing her finger against her teeth and gazing into the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/233.mp3	i watched her a few moments with a feeling of malevolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had anything more to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/234.mp3	yes yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/235.mp3	suppose i do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/236.mp3	she paused in evident disconcertion and perplexity mingled with anger she dared not show
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/237.mp3	i cannot renounce what is dearer than life she muttered in a low hurried tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/238.mp3	if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am i your rival ready to acknowledge myself your debtor for an act of the most noble forbearance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/239.mp3	i shall not tell him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/240.mp3	give me no thanks it is not for your sake that i refrain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/241.mp3	and milicent will you tell her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/242.mp3	i would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her relation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/243.mp3	you use hard words missus huntingdon but i can pardon you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/244.mp3	how dare you mention his name to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/245.mp3	the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/246.mp3	cosette had waked up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/247.mp3	jean valjean had placed her near the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/248.mp3	you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/249.mp3	everything is arranged and nothing is said fauchelevent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/250.mp3	i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/251.mp3	that's where the difficulty lies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/252.mp3	it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/253.mp3	and she will hold her tongue i answer for that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/254.mp3	fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/255.mp3	you understand father madeleine the government will notice it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/256.mp3	jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/257.mp3	fauchelevent went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/258.mp3	it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the prioress expects you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/259.mp3	then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/260.mp3	that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/261.mp3	that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/262.mp3	that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/263.mp3	and then that there was another the empty coffin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/264.mp3	what is that empty coffin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/265.mp3	asked jean valjean fauchelevent replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/266.mp3	what coffin what administration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/267.mp3	fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/268.mp3	you know fauchelevent what you have said mother crucifixion is dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/269.mp3	and i add and father madeleine is buried ah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/270.mp3	you are not like other men father madeleine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/271.mp3	this offers the means but give me some information in the first place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/272.mp3	how long is the coffin six feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/273.mp3	it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church what church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/274.mp3	the church in the street the church which any one can enter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/275.mp3	have you the keys to those two doors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/276.mp3	no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/277.mp3	only to allow the undertaker's men to enter when they come to get the coffin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/278.mp3	who nails up the coffin i do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/279.mp3	who spreads the pall over it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/280.mp3	not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room that is even written on the wall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/281.mp3	could you hide me in that room to night when every one is asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/282.mp3	about three o'clock in the afternoon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/283.mp3	i shall be hungry i will bring you something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/284.mp3	you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/285.mp3	fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/286.mp3	bah impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/287.mp3	jean valjean had been in worse straits than this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/288.mp3	any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/289.mp3	what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/290.mp3	to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/291.mp3	you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loosely good and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/292.mp3	a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/293.mp3	who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/294.mp3	the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/295.mp3	but jean valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/296.mp3	if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/297.mp3	an old fellow of the old school the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/298.mp3	i shall follow that is my business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/299.mp3	the hearse halts the undertaker's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/300.mp3	the priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/301.mp3	one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/302.mp3	that is settled father fauchelevent all will go well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/303.mp3	on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls cross bones and tears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/304.mp3	this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/305.mp3	a mourning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/306.mp3	behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/307.mp3	the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/308.mp3	these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/309.mp3	dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/310.mp3	the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugirard it hinted at poverty pere lachaise if you please
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/311.mp3	to be buried in pere lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/312.mp3	the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean to the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/313.mp3	it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/314.mp3	the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/315.mp3	in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/316.mp3	make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/317.mp3	a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/318.mp3	fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/319.mp3	jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/320.mp3	what remained to be done was a mere nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/321.mp3	he played with father mestienne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/322.mp3	he did what he liked with him he made him dance according to his whim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/323.mp3	the permission for interment must be exhibited
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/324.mp3	he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/325.mp3	the man replied the grave digger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/326.mp3	the grave digger yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/327.mp3	you i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/328.mp3	father mestienne is the grave digger he was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/329.mp3	fauchelevent had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/330.mp3	it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/331.mp3	he had hardly the strength to stammer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/332.mp3	but he persisted feebly father mestienne is the grave digger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/333.mp3	do you know who little father lenoir is he is a jug of red wine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/334.mp3	but you are a jolly fellow too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/335.mp3	are you not comrade we'll go and have a drink together presently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/336.mp3	the man replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/337.mp3	he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/338.mp3	the grave digger walked on in front of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/339.mp3	fauchelevent passed the unexpected gribier once more in review
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/340.mp3	fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/341.mp3	so father mestienne is dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/342.mp3	the man replied completely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/343.mp3	the good god consulted his note book which shows when the time is up it was father mestienne's turn father mestienne died
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/344.mp3	stammered fauchelevent it is made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/345.mp3	you are a peasant i am a parisian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/346.mp3	fauchelevent thought i am lost
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/347.mp3	they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns corner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/348.mp3	and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/349.mp3	fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/350.mp3	my father was a porter at the prytaneum town hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/351.mp3	but he had reverses he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/352.mp3	so you are not a grave digger then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/353.mp3	returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/354.mp3	here a remark becomes necessary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/355.mp3	fauchelevent whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/356.mp3	the grave digger went on with a superior smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/357.mp3	one must eat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/358.mp3	the commons also voted that the new created peers ought to have no voice in this trial because the accusation being agreed to while they were commoners their consent to it was implied with that of all the commons of england

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/360.mp3	the case of lord mountnorris of all those which were collected with so much industry is the most flagrant and the least excusable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/361.mp3	the court which consisted of the chief officers of the army found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/362.mp3	where the token by which i should discover it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/363.mp3	it is now full two hundred and forty years since treasons were defined and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this crime before myself

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/371.mp3	immediately after dinner that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to east hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/372.mp3	i'm not coming said annie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/373.mp3	every student is to be in east hall at half past eight

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/375.mp3	it burned as if with fever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/376.mp3	you don't know what a trial it is for me to have you here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/377.mp3	i want to be alone go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/378.mp3	i know you don't quite mean what you say said leslie but of course if you really wish me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/379.mp3	you fret me beyond endurance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/380.mp3	wrapping a pretty blue shawl round her head and shoulders she turned to annie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/381.mp3	leslie was just closing the door behind her when annie called after her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/382.mp3	i took it out said leslie took it out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/383.mp3	have the goodness to find it and put it back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/384.mp3	but don't lock me out please annie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/385.mp3	oh i won't lock you out she said but i must have the key
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/386.mp3	jane heriot's voice was heard in the passage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/387.mp3	as she walked down the corridor she heard it being turned in the lock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/388.mp3	what can this mean she said to herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/389.mp3	oh i won't press you replied jane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/390.mp3	oh i shall never do that replied leslie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/391.mp3	you see all the girls except eileen and marjorie laugh at her and that seems to me to make her worse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/392.mp3	some day jane you must see her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/393.mp3	if you are in london during the summer you must come and pay us a visit will you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/394.mp3	that is if you care to confide in me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/395.mp3	i believe poor annie is dreadfully unhappy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/396.mp3	that's just it jane that is what frightens me she refuses to come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/397.mp3	refuses to come she cried
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/398.mp3	she will get into an awful scrape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/399.mp3	i am sure she is ill she works too hard and she but there i don't know that i ought to say any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/400.mp3	i'll wait for you here said leslie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/401.mp3	do come annie do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/402.mp3	scarcely likely replied leslie she told me she was determined not to come to the meeting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/403.mp3	but marjorie and eileen had already departed and leslie and jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the great east hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/404.mp3	miss lauderdale was standing with the other tutors and principals of the different halls on a raised platform
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/405.mp3	then a roll call was gone through by one of the tutors the only absentee was annie colchester
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/406.mp3	the physical part of your training and also the mental part are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning she continued but the spiritual part it seems to me ought now to be strengthened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/407.mp3	hear hear and once again hear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/408.mp3	she uttered her strange remark standing up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/409.mp3	marjorie and eileen were close to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/410.mp3	i will talk with you belle acheson presently she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/411.mp3	the names of proposed members are to be submitted to me before this day week
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/412.mp3	am i my brother's keeper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/413.mp3	you ask she continued

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/415.mp3	the world says no i am not but god says yes you are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/416.mp3	all men are your brothers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/417.mp3	for all who sin all who suffer you are to a certain extent responsible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/418.mp3	after the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak and a very animated discussion followed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/419.mp3	it was past ten o'clock when she left the hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/420.mp3	just as she was doing so miss frere came up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/421.mp3	annie colchester is your roomfellow is she not she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/422.mp3	i see by your face miss gilroy that you are distressed about something are you keeping anything back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/423.mp3	i am afraid i am replied leslie distress now in her tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/424.mp3	i must see her myself early in the morning and i am quite sure that nothing will satisfy miss lauderdale except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she absented herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/425.mp3	excuses make no difference
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/426.mp3	the girl who breaks the rules has to be punished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/427.mp3	i will tell her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/428.mp3	annie colchester had begun to make friends with leslie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/429.mp3	leslie determined to try for honors in english language and literature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/430.mp3	her tastes all lay in this direction her idea being by and by to follow her mother's profession of journalism for which she already showed considerable aptitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/431.mp3	she had no idea of allowing herself to break down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/432.mp3	what do you mean replied leslie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/433.mp3	why you will be parting from me you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/434.mp3	i won't be the constant worry and plague of your life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/435.mp3	it is this if by any chance you don't leave saint wode's annie i hope you will allow me to be your roomfellow again next term
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/436.mp3	said annie a flash of light coming into her eyes and then leaving them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/437.mp3	but she added abruptly you speak of something which must not take place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/438.mp3	i must pass in honors if i don't i shall die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/439.mp3	a few moments later there came a tap at the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/440.mp3	leslie opened the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/441.mp3	jane heriot stood without
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/442.mp3	these letters have just come for you and annie colchester she said and as i was coming upstairs i thought i would leave them with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/443.mp3	leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/444.mp3	her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news the other letter was directed to annie colchester
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/445.mp3	here is a letter for you annie cried leslie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/446.mp3	her face grew suddenly white as death what is it dear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/447.mp3	i have been starving or rather i have been thirsting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/448.mp3	well read it in peace said leslie i won't disturb you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/449.mp3	i am truly glad it has come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/450.mp3	leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/451.mp3	don't notice me replied annie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/452.mp3	i must go into the grounds the air is stifling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/453.mp3	but they are just shutting up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/454.mp3	i shall go i know a way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/455.mp3	just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/456.mp3	she looked round the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/457.mp3	now i remember she got a letter which upset her very much and went out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/458.mp3	leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already set and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/459.mp3	she is a very queer erratic creature and that letter there was bad news in that letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/460.mp3	what can she be doing out by herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/461.mp3	leslie left the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen paces down the corridor before she met annie returning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/462.mp3	annie's eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/463.mp3	she did not take the least notice of leslie but going into the room shut the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/464.mp3	don't begin said annie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/465.mp3	don't begin what do you mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/466.mp3	i mean that i don't want you to begin to ask questions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/467.mp3	i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to make myself sleepy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/468.mp3	don't talk to me leslie don't say a single word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/469.mp3	i shall go off to sleep that is all i care for
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/470.mp3	don't said annie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/471.mp3	now drink this at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/472.mp3	annie stared vacantly at the cocoa then she uttered a laugh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/473.mp3	drink that she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/474.mp3	do you want to kill me don't talk any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/475.mp3	i am sleepy i shall sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/476.mp3	she got into bed as she spoke and wrapped the clothes tightly round her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/477.mp3	can't you manage with a candle just for once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/478.mp3	certainly said leslie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/479.mp3	she turned off the light and lit a candle which she put behind her screen then prepared to get into bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/480.mp3	annie's manner was very mysterious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/481.mp3	annie did not mean to confide in anyone that night and the kindest thing was to leave her alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/482.mp3	tired out leslie herself dropped asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/483.mp3	annie is that you she called out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/484.mp3	there was no reply but the sound of hurrying steps came quicker and quicker now and then they were interrupted by a groan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/485.mp3	oh this will kill me my heart will break this will kill me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/486.mp3	she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took puttel into her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/487.mp3	the more proposals the more credit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/488.mp3	i ve tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/489.mp3	just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/490.mp3	what a spiteful thing i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/491.mp3	i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/492.mp3	let me see how can i begin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/493.mp3	he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/494.mp3	now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull hard working days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/495.mp3	i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/496.mp3	it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/497.mp3	this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to every one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/498.mp3	lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/499.mp3	at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even gratitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/500.mp3	polly felt a very cordial friendship for mister sydney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/501.mp3	this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with a spice of the old eve in her composition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/502.mp3	when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and bess but could n't resist stopping at the shaws to leave a little parcel for fan though it was calling time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/503.mp3	a foolish little speech to make to a dog but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying to do her duty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/504.mp3	take hold of master charley's hand miss mamie and walk pretty like willy and flossy said the maid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/505.mp3	at a street corner a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosy faced school girl whose music roll he was reluctantly surrendering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/506.mp3	how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her that she had n't the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/507.mp3	she really could n't help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/508.mp3	that is the way i get to the roths answered polly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/509.mp3	she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/510.mp3	but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mend her faults though she won't own it and will surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/511.mp3	thank you no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/512.mp3	how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/513.mp3	asked the artful young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/514.mp3	he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/515.mp3	so when she made her last brilliant remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i m going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoyed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/516.mp3	she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i ve no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far too transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a white lie cleverly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/517.mp3	he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/518.mp3	polly did not return to her favorite walk till she learned from minnie that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/519.mp3	wagging to and fro as usual what's the news with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/520.mp3	perhaps she ll jilt him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/521.mp3	utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/522.mp3	minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about rubbers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/523.mp3	now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dear has n't he proposed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/524.mp3	don't you think he means to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/525.mp3	truly truly fan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/526.mp3	i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/527.mp3	well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/528.mp3	i just gave him a hint and he took it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/529.mp3	he meant to go away before that so don't think his heart is broken or mind what silly tattlers say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/530.mp3	he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/531.mp3	but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/532.mp3	i m odd you know and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/533.mp3	never mind what the business was it suffices to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who having been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city in new england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the west to widen his views and make a man of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/534.mp3	fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/535.mp3	pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind though the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of the partings that must be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/536.mp3	if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called till his vacation came and a voluminous correspondence with polly beguiled the long days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/537.mp3	tom wrote once a week to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/538.mp3	no i m only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather makes me just a trifle blue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/539.mp3	forgive me polly but i can't help saying it for it is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/540.mp3	i try not to deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/541.mp3	thank heaven for that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/542.mp3	cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/543.mp3	poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/544.mp3	none were needed her telltale face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich when the hunters are after it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/545.mp3	once or twice but sort of jokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/546.mp3	it was so stupid of me not to guess before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/547.mp3	it was so tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover in admiration of polly's loyalty to hers for this faithful all absorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/548.mp3	i hope maria bailey is all he thinks her she added softly for i could n't bear to have him disappointed again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/549.mp3	said fanny turning hopeful all at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/550.mp3	suppose i say a word to tom just inquire after his heart in a general way you know and give him a chance to tell me if there is anything to tell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/551.mp3	bear it people always do bear things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/552.mp3	it was a very different winter from the last for both the girls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/553.mp3	if fanny wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded better than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined to prove that change of fortune made no difference to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/554.mp3	she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasanter to sit dreaming over book or sewing alone than to exert herself even to go to the shaws
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/555.mp3	polly was not at all like herself that winter and those nearest to her saw and wondered at it most
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/556.mp3	for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole bailey question and left them in utter darkness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/557.mp3	fanny came walking in upon her one day looking as if she brought tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/558.mp3	but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/559.mp3	the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i wake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/560.mp3	yes but if i should already ask for something what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/561.mp3	well do it for me for i swear to you that i don't love you as the others have loved you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/562.mp3	there are bolts on the door wretch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/563.mp3	i don't know how it is but it seems to me as if i do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/564.mp3	now go i can't keep my eyes open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/565.mp3	it seemed to me as if this sleeping city belonged to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/566.mp3	education family feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first counsels of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/567.mp3	the more a girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young man of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/568.mp3	then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mysterious veil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/569.mp3	with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/570.mp3	they love by profession and not by instinct
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/571.mp3	when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/572.mp3	they know not what proof to give
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/573.mp3	in order to disturb the labourers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/574.mp3	it is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/575.mp3	but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/576.mp3	but to return to the first day of my liaison
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/577.mp3	when i reached home i was in a state of mad gaiety
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/578.mp3	the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/579.mp3	how why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/580.mp3	my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/581.mp3	here are my orders to night at the vaudeville
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/582.mp3	come during the third entr'acte
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/583.mp3	the boxes filled one after another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/584.mp3	only one remained empty the stage box
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/585.mp3	at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/586.mp3	did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked the happier i should be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/587.mp3	what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/588.mp3	you should go to bed she replied with that ironical air which went so well with her delicate and witty face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/589.mp3	where at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/590.mp3	you still love me can you ask
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/591.mp3	because you don't like seeing him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/592.mp3	nonetheless i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marguerite get into the carriage which was waiting for them at the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/593.mp3	ol mistah buzzard grinned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/594.mp3	this sounded like another story
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/595.mp3	he was curious about that black headed cousin of ol mistah buzzard very curious indeed

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/599.mp3	way back in the days when grandpap buzzard had his lil falling out with ol king eagle and done fly so high he sco'tch the feathers offen his haid he had a cousin did grandpap buzzard and this cousin was jes naturally lazy and no count
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/600.mp3	like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of hisself poking his nose into ev'ybody's business and never tending to his own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/601.mp3	wasn't anything going on that this trifling member of the buzzard fam'ly didn't find out about and meddle in he could ask mo questions than peter rabbit can an anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/602.mp3	everybody looked at peter and laughed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/603.mp3	so we uns sit on the chimney tops whenever ol jack frost gets to straying down where he have no business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/604.mp3	one day this no count trifling cousin of grandpap buzzard get cold in his feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/605.mp3	it was on a lil ol house a lil ol tumble down house

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/609.mp3	yes sah she sho'ly was plumb scared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/610.mp3	they like to choke that no count buzzard to death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/611.mp3	when he get home he try an try to brush that soot off but it done get into the skin an it stay there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/612.mp3	a little sigh of satisfaction went around the circle of listeners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/613.mp3	it was just as good as one of grandfather frog's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/614.mp3	i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/615.mp3	you in the way marguerite but how
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/616.mp3	well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/617.mp3	during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/618.mp3	my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/619.mp3	yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/620.mp3	because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/621.mp3	is that really the only reason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/622.mp3	if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/623.mp3	honestly do you care for me a little a great deal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/624.mp3	i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/625.mp3	well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/626.mp3	i listened and i gazed at marguerite with admiration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/627.mp3	when i thought that this marvellous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire has indeed limits when satisfied as promptly as mine had been it reached after something further
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/628.mp3	truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desires and inconceivable loves

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/635.mp3	i thought i could accept the life which he offered me but what would you have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/636.mp3	what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/637.mp3	marguerite tired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to her lips and from that to her eyes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/645.mp3	i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/650.mp3	thus spake zarathustra to his heart and ran away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/651.mp3	verily my folly hath grown big in the mountains
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/652.mp3	now do i hear six old fools legs rattling behind one another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/653.mp3	but doth zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/654.mp3	also methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/655.mp3	for when zarathustra scrutinised him with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition so slender swarthy hollow and worn out did this follower appear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/656.mp3	asked zarathustra vehemently what doest thou here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/657.mp3	and why callest thou thyself my shadow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/658.mp3	thou art not pleasing unto me

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/662.mp3	the devil himself is perhaps skin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/663.mp3	sometimes i meant to lie and behold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/664.mp3	then only did i hit the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/665.mp3	how have i still inclination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/666.mp3	have i still a goal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/667.mp3	a haven towards which my sail is set
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/668.mp3	for it do i ask and seek and have sought but have not found it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/669.mp3	o eternal everywhere o eternal nowhere o eternal in vain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/670.mp3	thou art my shadow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/671.mp3	said he at last sadly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/672.mp3	thy danger is not small thou free spirit and wanderer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/673.mp3	they sleep quietly they enjoy their new security
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/674.mp3	beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee a hard rigorous delusion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/675.mp3	for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and tempteth thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/676.mp3	thou hast lost thy goal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/677.mp3	thou poor rover and rambler thou tired butterfly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/678.mp3	wilt thou have a rest and a home this evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/679.mp3	what hath happened unto me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/680.mp3	he asked himself something warm and living quickeneth me it must be in the neighbourhood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/681.mp3	when however zarathustra was quite nigh unto them then did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the kine and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/682.mp3	what do i here seek
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/683.mp3	answered he the same that thou seekest thou mischief maker that is to say happiness upon earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/684.mp3	for i tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto them and just now were they about to give me their answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/685.mp3	he would not be rid of his affliction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/686.mp3	who hath not at present his heart his mouth and his eyes full of disgust
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/687.mp3	thou also thou also
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/688.mp3	but behold these kine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/689.mp3	the kine however gazed at it all and wondered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/690.mp3	wanton avidity bilious envy careworn revenge populace pride all these struck mine eye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/691.mp3	it is no longer true that the poor are blessed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/692.mp3	the kingdom of heaven however is with the kine and why is it not with the rich
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/693.mp3	why dost thou tempt me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/694.mp3	answered the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/695.mp3	thou knowest it thyself better even than i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/696.mp3	thus spake the peaceful one and puffed himself and perspired with his words so that the kine wondered anew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/697.mp3	thou doest violence to thyself thou preacher on the mount when thou usest such severe words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/698.mp3	they also abstain from all heavy thoughts which inflate the heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/699.mp3	well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/700.mp3	said zarathustra thou shouldst also see mine animals mine eagle and my serpent their like do not at present exist on earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/701.mp3	and talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/702.mp3	now however take leave at once of thy kine thou strange one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/703.mp3	thou amiable one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/704.mp3	for they are thy warmest friends and preceptors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/705.mp3	thou evil flatterer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/706.mp3	thus accomplished he excited the admiration of every silly coquette and the envy of every fluttering coxcomb but by all young gentlemen and ladies of understanding he was heartily despised as a mere civilized monkey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/707.mp3	that his soul might afterwards occupy such a station as would be most suitable to his character it was sentenced to inhabit the body of that finical grinning and mischievous little mimick with four legs which you now behold before you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/708.mp3	once upon a time a brahman who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger had been shut up by the villagers who caught him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/709.mp3	the brahman answered no i will not for if i let you out of the cage you will eat me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/710.mp3	oh father of mercy answered the tiger in truth that i will not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/711.mp3	i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/712.mp3	then the brahman took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he done so than the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/713.mp3	so the brahman and the tiger walked on till they came to a banyan tree and the brahman said to it banyan tree banyan tree hear and give judgment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/714.mp3	on what must i give judgment asked the banyan tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/715.mp3	this tiger said the brahman begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have let him out he wishes to eat me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/716.mp3	is it just that he should do so or no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/717.mp3	let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/718.mp3	sir camel sir camel cried the brahman hear and give judgment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/719.mp3	at a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/720.mp3	is it fair that he should do so or not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/721.mp3	let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/722.mp3	three out of the six had given judgment against the brahman but still he did not lose all hope and determined to ask the other three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/723.mp3	on what must i give judgment asked the eagle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/724.mp3	the brahman stated the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they try to shoot me they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/725.mp3	then the tiger began to roar and said the judgment of all is against you o brahman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/726.mp3	after this they saw an alligator and the brahman related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/727.mp3	but the alligator said whenever i put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/728.mp3	the brahman gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/729.mp3	now the sixth was a jackal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/730.mp3	the brahman told his story and said to him uncle jackal uncle jackal say what is your judgment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/731.mp3	show me the place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/732.mp3	when they got there the jackal said now brahman show me exactly where you stood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/733.mp3	exactly there was it asked the jackal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/734.mp3	exactly here replied the brahman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/735.mp3	where was the tiger then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/736.mp3	why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/737.mp3	very good said the jackal but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/738.mp3	shut and bolted said the brahman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/739.mp3	then shut and bolt it said the jackal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/740.mp3	when the brahman had done this the jackal said oh you wicked and ungrateful tiger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/741.mp3	when the good brahman opened your cage door is to eat him the only return you would make
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/742.mp3	proceed on your journey friend brahman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/743.mp3	your road lies that way and mine this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/744.mp3	say you know sumthin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/745.mp3	chris looked from a nickel plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/746.mp3	know who needs a job bad that's jakey harris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/747.mp3	o k he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/748.mp3	only why didn't you ask him yourself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/749.mp3	mike became uneasy and fished an elastic band out of his pocket made a flick of paper and sent it soaring out into m street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/750.mp3	well he admitted i did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/751.mp3	chris asked and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/752.mp3	think he really needs it he pursued
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/753.mp3	he would have liked to get the job for jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edging into the streets was not what chris had intended for ending the afternoon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/754.mp3	mike's expression changed at once to one of triumph but chris was only partly encouraged
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/755.mp3	betcha aren't goin after all chris turned on him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/756.mp3	mike was standing on the corner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/757.mp3	aw shucks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/758.mp3	chris started off once more passing the bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mister wicker's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/759.mp3	an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the l shaped brick building that served mister wicker as both house and place of business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/760.mp3	the longer wing toward the back had a back door that opened onto water street the space between the house and wisconsin avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the sidewalk by box shrubs and a white picket fence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/761.mp3	a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and gray clouds lowered and tumbled above
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/762.mp3	the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish his job
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/763.mp3	all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him pinched and tightened itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/764.mp3	at the foot of the hill he reached the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/765.mp3	there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/766.mp3	on the left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy in baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/767.mp3	but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/768.mp3	he had never seen anyone go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/769.mp3	how then did he live and what did he ever sell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/770.mp3	a sudden car horn woke him from his dream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/771.mp3	the learning of magic was by no means easy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/772.mp3	he had told his master at once about simon gosler his horde of money and his hiding places for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/773.mp3	chris therefore threw himself into all the preliminaries of his task
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/774.mp3	one afternoon when he returned after a rest to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bowl with a goldfish in it stood on the table but mister wicker was not to be seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/775.mp3	what shall i do first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/776.mp3	how you have improved my boy he exclaimed it is now time for you to try and this is as good a change as any
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/777.mp3	suppose i change and can't change back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/778.mp3	mister wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/779.mp3	then as nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wicker said start at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/780.mp3	the sensation spread faster and faster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/781.mp3	his head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he persisted through the final words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/782.mp3	he thought not without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mister wicker's voice boomed close by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/783.mp3	seventy four book one the return
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/784.mp3	the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style had curved up pointing toes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/785.mp3	then all at once the idea came to chris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/786.mp3	if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/787.mp3	he squatted on his haunches examining the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/788.mp3	but how did one change inanimate to animate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/789.mp3	chris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/790.mp3	he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty chris resumed his proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/791.mp3	the afternoon rainy before increased in storm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/792.mp3	dusk came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/793.mp3	certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/794.mp3	mister wicker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/795.mp3	with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure of the negro boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/796.mp3	it was as if the stiffness melted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/797.mp3	under his eyes the wooden folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/798.mp3	the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of carved flowers moved and let the bouquet fall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/799.mp3	of the many times he had examined mister wicker's window and pored over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister wicker's shop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/800.mp3	so now alone until someone should answer the bell he looked eagerly if uneasily around him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/801.mp3	what with the one window and the lowering day outside the long narrow shop was somber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/802.mp3	heavy hand hewn beams crossed it from one side to the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/803.mp3	mister wicker's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/804.mp3	the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/805.mp3	little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/806.mp3	chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/807.mp3	chris swallowed and his voice came back to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/808.mp3	yes sir he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/809.mp3	i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/810.mp3	he's a schoolmate of mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/811.mp3	jakey harris his name is and he really needs the job
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/812.mp3	i i just wondered if the place was still open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/813.mp3	what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/814.mp3	he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/815.mp3	would that interfere with jakey's getting the job sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/816.mp3	but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of water street and up the hill toward the traffic signals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/817.mp3	the room seemed overly still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/818.mp3	then in that second he turned and faced about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/819.mp3	the wide bow window was there before him the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/820.mp3	across the water where was the freeway
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/821.mp3	it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/822.mp3	the warehouses were still there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/823.mp3	flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/824.mp3	no electric signs no lamplit streets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/825.mp3	where the people's drugstore had stood but a half hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/826.mp3	a courtyard was sparsely lit by a flaring torch or two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/827.mp3	the post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and muddy road
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/828.mp3	a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/829.mp3	they moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/830.mp3	my window has a power for those few who are to see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/831.mp3	they went down to their quarters first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/832.mp3	guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/833.mp3	next ned cilley was relieved at the helm by elbert jones who took over ned went on down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/834.mp3	it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who i'll keep my eyes open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/835.mp3	the mirabelle was nearing tahiti
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/836.mp3	we've water and fresh stores to take on there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/837.mp3	chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/838.mp3	certainly my boy boomed out the captain his blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/839.mp3	mister finney will be some time on deck we cannot be overheard in here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/840.mp3	his face froze with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain blizzard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/841.mp3	the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/842.mp3	then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/843.mp3	this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/844.mp3	he paused fingering his lower lip and looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/845.mp3	we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/846.mp3	this ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/847.mp3	yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/848.mp3	captain blizzard's round pink face creased in his winning smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/849.mp3	he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/850.mp3	camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time yet understood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/851.mp3	what can be said during that time sir chris thought to ask
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/852.mp3	i am somewhat skilled in medicaments i have to be as captain of a ship and the crew know it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/853.mp3	i shall say that you are in my own cabin so that i can care for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/854.mp3	not since he had left mister wicker had chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/855.mp3	he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/856.mp3	their conversation had taken some little while
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/857.mp3	even the sun came out pale and watery at noon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/858.mp3	the colds and rheumatism of the rainy months vanished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/859.mp3	asked a worker last sunday you did it when the yunkers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/860.mp3	well didn't they shoot us one man exhibited his arm in a sling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/861.mp3	haven't i got something to remember them by the devils
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/862.mp3	who are you to destroy the legal government who is lenin a german
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/863.mp3	who are you a counter revolutionist a provocator they bellowed at him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/864.mp3	you call yourselves the people of russia but you're not the people of russia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/865.mp3	the peasants are the people of russia wait until the peasants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/866.mp3	we know what the peasants will say aren't they workingmen like ourselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/867.mp3	these men especially welcomed the call to a congress of peasants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/868.mp3	these last were the young generation who had been serving in the army
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/869.mp3	whereupon the old executive committee left the hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/870.mp3	down with him they shrieked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/871.mp3	fearful tumult cries down with the bolsheviki
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/872.mp3	upon my return i visited smolny no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let any one present make such an accusation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/873.mp3	meanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/874.mp3	by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to block the reelection of the executive committee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/875.mp3	but this worked both ways the left socialist revolutionists decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/876.mp3	on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian programme of the bolsheviki and the left socialist revolutionaries
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/877.mp3	the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/878.mp3	followed him lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/879.mp3	the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalists and land owners whose interests are closely related
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/880.mp3	the dumas and zemstvos were dropped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/881.mp3	he knew that an agreement with the bolsheviki was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/882.mp3	he spoke to the rump convention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/883.mp3	the villages will save us in the end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/884.mp3	but the present movement is international and that is why it is invincible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/885.mp3	the will of millions of workers is now concentrated in this hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/886.mp3	a new humanity will be born of this war
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/887.mp3	i greet you with the christening of a new russian life and freedom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/888.mp3	poor ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so boeotian as at that moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/889.mp3	the women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and cursorily deplored in missus luna's sister
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/890.mp3	ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/891.mp3	he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/892.mp3	she could not defend herself against a rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of any one who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/893.mp3	his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/894.mp3	the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age alighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/895.mp3	it was in the female line as basil ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/896.mp3	if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of ascertaining how such an offering would be taken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/897.mp3	olive had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/898.mp3	she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/899.mp3	she was perfectly safe after writing to basil ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superlative for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/900.mp3	he was too simple too mississippian for that she was almost disappointed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/901.mp3	of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her though why it is hard to imagine for it always cost her tears headaches a day or two in bed acute emotion and it was very possible basil ransom would not care to contend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/902.mp3	the gentleman had not even needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in its pages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/903.mp3	that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/904.mp3	she is willing to risk that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/905.mp3	just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with rather a work a day aspect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/906.mp3	he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/907.mp3	in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/908.mp3	those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was a head to be seen above the level of a crowd on some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/909.mp3	these things the eyes especially with their smouldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have proved that he came from carolina or alabama
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/910.mp3	and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that he prolonged his consonants and swallowed his vowels that he was guilty of elisions and interpolations which were equally unexpected and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something almost african in its rich basking tone something that suggested the teeming expanse of the cotton field
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/911.mp3	and he took up his hat vaguely a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/912.mp3	well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and roaring radicals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/913.mp3	if you are going to dine with her you had better know it oh murder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/914.mp3	he looked at missus luna with intelligent incredulity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/915.mp3	she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/916.mp3	have you been in europe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/917.mp3	no i haven't been anywhere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/918.mp3	she hates it she would like to abolish it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/919.mp3	this last remark he made at a venture for he had naturally not devoted any supposition whatever to missus luna
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/920.mp3	are you very ambitious you look as if you were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/921.mp3	and missus luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/922.mp3	one didn't even know what one had come back for
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/923.mp3	besides olive didn't want her in boston and didn't go through the form of saying so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/924.mp3	that was one comfort with olive she never went through any forms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/925.mp3	she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously at mister ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/926.mp3	her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended a slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in missus luna's indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/927.mp3	he observed that miss chancellor's hand was at once cold and limp she merely placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/928.mp3	i shall be back very late we are going to a theatre party that's why we dine so early
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/929.mp3	missus luna's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chancellor that she looked as if she were got up for a sea voyage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/930.mp3	miss chancellor herself had thought so much on the vital subject would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/931.mp3	how did the ladies on beacon street feel about the ballot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/932.mp3	perhaps she could speak for them more than for some others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/933.mp3	with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reformers were a little different
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/934.mp3	olive hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it were such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of worldly glory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/935.mp3	all sorts of inferior people lived there and so brilliant a woman as missus farrinder who lived at roxbury ought not to mix things up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/936.mp3	she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what missus farrinder supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/937.mp3	she wished to work in another field she had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/938.mp3	this might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/939.mp3	charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/940.mp3	olive chancellor wondered how missus farrinder would treat that branch of the question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/941.mp3	if it be necessary we are prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/942.mp3	our movement is for all it appeals to the most delicate ladies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/943.mp3	raise the standard among them and bring me a thousand names
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/944.mp3	i look after the details as well as the big currents missus farrinder added in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/945.mp3	said olive chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/946.mp3	i want to be near to them to help them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/947.mp3	it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enfranchisement of their sex from every form of bondage had chosen for her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/948.mp3	the unhappiness of women

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/962.mp3	yes she answered that little group yonder a young minister and his wife and child i suppose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/963.mp3	and what a dear little fellow he is just about the age of our harold i should judge

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/967.mp3	i do indeed though probably comparatively few are aware that tobacco is the cause of their ailments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/968.mp3	doubtless that is the case remarked mister dinsmore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/969.mp3	with all my heart if you will step into the gentlemen's cabin where there's a light

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/973.mp3	is it strange then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/974.mp3	that the french polytechnic institute had to prohibit its use on account of its effects on the mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/975.mp3	notice the multitude of sudden deaths and see how many are smokers and chewers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/976.mp3	in a small country town seven of these mysterious providences occurred within the circuit of a mile all directly traceable to tobacco and any physician on a few moments reflection can match this fact by his own observation

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/982.mp3	and again i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/983.mp3	it must require a good deal of resolution for one who has become fond of the indulgence to give it up remarked mister daly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/984.mp3	no doubt no doubt returned mister lilburn but if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/985.mp3	there was a pause broken by young horace who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/986.mp3	they are gambling yonder and i'm afraid that young fellow is being badly fleeced by that middle aged man opposite

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/997.mp3	they heard him in silence with a cool phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/998.mp3	a man of giant size and herculean strength had laid aside his pipe and slowly rising to his feet seized the scoundrel in his powerful grasp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/999.mp3	let me go yelled ward making a desperate effort to free his arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1000.mp3	i dinks no i dinks i deach you von lesson returned his captor not relaxing his grasp in the least

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1002.mp3	mister lilburn and mister daly each at a different time sought out the young man ward's intended victim and tried to influence him for good

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1005.mp3	then mister lilburn waking from his first sleep in a stateroom near by thought he would break it up once more

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1007.mp3	they bent eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements each casting now and again a gloating eye upon the heap of gold and greenbacks that lay between them and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1008.mp3	a deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1009.mp3	but all was silent and after a moment of anxious waiting they sat down to their game again trying to conceal and shake off their fears with a forced unnatural laugh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1010.mp3	it came from under the table gasped ward look what's there look yourself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1011.mp3	what can it have been they asked each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1012.mp3	oh nonsense what fools we are

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1016.mp3	oh how kind how very kind missus daly said with tears of joy and gratitude we have hardly known how we should meet the most necessary expenses of this trip but have been trying to cast our care upon the lord asking him to provide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1017.mp3	and how wonderfully he has answered our petitions

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1032.mp3	because dom mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merlonus horstius only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise merlonus horstius neither do i

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1050.mp3	and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1051.mp3	it was mother crucifixion

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1053.mp3	the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church i know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1054.mp3	a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dead room more often
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1055.mp3	hey more often
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1056.mp3	what do you say

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1061.mp3	at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prioress

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1063.mp3	fauchelevent mopped his forehead

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1071.mp3	fauchelevent held his peace she went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1072.mp3	i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1167.mp3	he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly a ballot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1168.mp3	he was shouting for the very course sergey ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1169.mp3	shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballot

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1171.mp3	the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshal he's not a cashier but that's not the point

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1173.mp3	they expressed the most implacable hatred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1174.mp3	levin did not in the least understand what was the matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flerov should be put to the vote
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1175.mp3	he forgot as sergey ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure flerov's right to vote that to secure the recognition of flerov's right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1176.mp3	but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1177.mp3	to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1178.mp3	he particularly liked the way one gray whiskered waiter who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1179.mp3	levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergey ivanovitch with the question where am i to put it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1180.mp3	sergey ivanovitch frowned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1181.mp3	that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1182.mp3	having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1183.mp3	a hundred and twenty six for admission ninety eight against
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1184.mp3	sang out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1185.mp3	then there was a laugh a button and two nuts were found in the box
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1186.mp3	but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1187.mp3	in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1188.mp3	this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1189.mp3	if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1190.mp3	and the marshal disappeared through a side door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1191.mp3	they were to proceed immediately to the election
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1192.mp3	two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1193.mp3	on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flerov to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1194.mp3	levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sviazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his equerry's uniform was standing with them in eager conversation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1195.mp3	he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1196.mp3	he's such a blackguard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1197.mp3	i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1198.mp3	these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1199.mp3	shall we go on your excellency fine champagne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1200.mp3	last year at our district marshal nikolay ivanovitch's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1201.mp3	oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1202.mp3	why what is there to understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1203.mp3	there's no meaning in it at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1204.mp3	then too one must keep up connections
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1205.mp3	it's a moral obligation of a sort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1206.mp3	and then to tell the truth there's one's own interests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1207.mp3	they're proprietors of a sort but we're the landowners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1208.mp3	that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1209.mp3	if we're laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you've a tree that's stood for centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1210.mp3	well and how is your land doing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1211.mp3	but one's work is thrown in for nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1212.mp3	oh well one does it what would you have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1213.mp3	and what's more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1214.mp3	so there'll be no one to keep it up and yet one does it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1215.mp3	we walked about the fields and the garden no said he stepan vassilievitch everything's well looked after but your garden's neglected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1216.mp3	to my thinking i'd cut down that lime tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1217.mp3	here you've thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1218.mp3	you're married i've heard said the landowner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1219.mp3	yes it's rather strange he went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1220.mp3	the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1221.mp3	why don't we cut down our parks for timber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1222.mp3	said levin returning to a thought that had struck him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1223.mp3	there's a class instinct too of what one ought and oughtn't to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1224.mp3	there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1225.mp3	without a return too at a simple loss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1226.mp3	captain lake did not look at all like a london dandy now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1227.mp3	there was a very natural savagery and dejection there and a wild leer in his yellow eyes rachel sat down

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1234.mp3	there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into her pale sharp features during the process
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1235.mp3	there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1236.mp3	and she threw back her veil and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1238.mp3	i'll stay here that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1239.mp3	he slackened his pace and tapped sharply at the little window of that modest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which luke waggot was wont to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1240.mp3	luke took care of mister larkin's dogs and groomed mister wylder's horse and cleaned up his dog cart for mark being close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and dog cart in the post office premises and so evaded the livery charges of the brandon arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1241.mp3	but luke was not there and captain lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver lion which has its gable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in gylingden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1242.mp3	here were the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns and tolerably long credits and the humble scapegraces of the town resorted thither for the pleasures of a club life and often revelled deep into the small hours of the morning

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1244.mp3	luke stuck on his greasy wideawake and in a few minutes more the dog cart was trundled out into the lane and the horse harnessed went between the shafts with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bear to be called up under startling circumstances at unseasonable hours

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1246.mp3	it is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of ashur by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1247.mp3	at the beginning of his reign there was much social discontent and suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1248.mp3	well might sharduris exclaim in the words of the prophet where is the king of arpad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1249.mp3	tiglath pileser however crossed the euphrates and moving northward delivered an unexpected attack on the urartian army in qummukh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1250.mp3	a fierce battle ensued and one of its dramatic incidents was a single combat between the rival kings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1251.mp3	an attempt was made to capture king sharduris who leapt from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback hotly pursued in the gathering darkness by an assyrian contingent of cavalry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1252.mp3	despite the blow dealt against urartu assyria did not immediately regain possession of north syria
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1253.mp3	the shifty mati ilu either cherished the hope that sharduris would recover strength and again invade north syria or that he might himself establish an empire in that region
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1254.mp3	tiglath pileser had therefore to march westward again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1255.mp3	for three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in the western land where he met with vigorous resistance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1256.mp3	arpad was captured and mati ilu deposed and probably put to death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1257.mp3	once again the hebrews came into contact with assyria
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1258.mp3	its fall may not have been unconnected with the trend of events in assyria during the closing years of the middle empire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1259.mp3	jehoash the grandson of jehu had achieved successes in conflict with damascus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1260.mp3	six months afterwards he was assassinated by shallum

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1337.mp3	educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1338.mp3	this is absolutely incorrect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1339.mp3	in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1340.mp3	the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1341.mp3	the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1342.mp3	the basis of authority is bodily violence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1343.mp3	the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1344.mp3	these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1345.mp3	the army has always been and still is the basis of power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1346.mp3	power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1347.mp3	indeed it could not be otherwise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1348.mp3	only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1349.mp3	but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1350.mp3	even if there was once a time when owing to the low standard of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1351.mp3	between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1352.mp3	it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1353.mp3	after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1354.mp3	but this justification is never more than temporary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1355.mp3	internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1356.mp3	government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1357.mp3	and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1358.mp3	the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1359.mp3	so it has always been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1360.mp3	footnote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1361.mp3	the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkerton's men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1362.mp3	the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1363.mp3	the meaning of caprivi's speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1364.mp3	and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1365.mp3	but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1366.mp3	and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1367.mp3	this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out one hundred fifty years ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1368.mp3	every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1369.mp3	the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1370.mp3	the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1371.mp3	and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1372.mp3	this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1373.mp3	in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1374.mp3	but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1375.mp3	but instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1376.mp3	the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1377.mp3	the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1378.mp3	but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1379.mp3	governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1380.mp3	they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1381.mp3	and for the sake of what am i making them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1382.mp3	i am expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1383.mp3	except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1384.mp3	we know now that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1385.mp3	so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1386.mp3	except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1387.mp3	without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing any thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1388.mp3	this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1389.mp3	the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1390.mp3	without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1391.mp3	the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1392.mp3	and if defense against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1393.mp3	the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1394.mp3	even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1395.mp3	to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1396.mp3	so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of the wealthy classes an oppressor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1397.mp3	for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1398.mp3	he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1407.mp3	yes that's an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1413.mp3	the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1414.mp3	but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1415.mp3	and then the mother wishes it he added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1416.mp3	ah well in that case to be sure let them go only those german quacks are mischievous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1417.mp3	oh time's up already and he went to the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1418.mp3	the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1419.mp3	oh no only a few details princess come this way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1420.mp3	and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1421.mp3	when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1422.mp3	she answered him and all at once got up furious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1423.mp3	excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1424.mp3	this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1425.mp3	the celebrated doctor did not take offense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1426.mp3	nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1427.mp3	and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1428.mp3	at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1429.mp3	finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1430.mp3	it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1431.mp3	the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1432.mp3	seemed in good spirits last night mister gurr eh

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1459.mp3	he swung round walked aft and began sweeping the shore again with his glass while the master and dick exchanged glances which meant a great deal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1460.mp3	at last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1461.mp3	pipe away the men to that boat there he said and as the crew sprang in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1462.mp3	now mister gurr he said i'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions yes sir

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1466.mp3	i'm going home to breakfast

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1468.mp3	stop here till sir risdon comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry nandy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1469.mp3	tell him not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have everything clear away to night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1470.mp3	the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archy raystoke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1471.mp3	what a queer dream he thought to himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1472.mp3	but how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helped the cook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1473.mp3	and why did andy call mister gurr father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1474.mp3	there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1475.mp3	and i'm hungry too time i was up i suppose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1476.mp3	no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1477.mp3	what did they say false alarm tell sir risdon they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster boat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1478.mp3	once out of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1479.mp3	oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing toward them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boot toes against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1480.mp3	ram was the first to recover from his surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1481.mp3	hullo he said who are you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1482.mp3	go round and open the door i was shut in last night by mistake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1483.mp3	i saw you last night and wondered whose boy you was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1484.mp3	it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly knowed you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1485.mp3	nonsense

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1487.mp3	think i don't know you mister orficer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1488.mp3	won't do said ram quickly i know you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1489.mp3	been playing the spy that's what you've been doing who locked you in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1490.mp3	archy stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1491.mp3	he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1492.mp3	nothing but the chimney presented itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1493.mp3	a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his breast he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labour in vain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1494.mp3	he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realised that the attempt was madness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1495.mp3	the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear assailing sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1496.mp3	but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1497.mp3	no i can't part with that ha ha ha laughed the boy jeeringly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1498.mp3	but i'll yes i'll give you a guinea if you will let me out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1499.mp3	guinea said the boy think i'd do it for a guinea well then two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1500.mp3	be quick there's a good fellow i want to get away at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1501.mp3	not you only a sham
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1502.mp3	why your clothes don't fit you and your cap's put on all skew rew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1503.mp3	never mind about that let me out of this place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1504.mp3	i told you a fisher boy cried archy impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1505.mp3	not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insolent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1506.mp3	archy checked himself and the boy laughed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1507.mp3	it was your turn yesterday it's mine to day what a game
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1508.mp3	you laughed and fleered at me when i was on the cutter's deck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1509.mp3	i say you do look a rum un just like a big monkey in a show
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1510.mp3	ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1511.mp3	you rope's end me he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1512.mp3	why i could tie you up in a knot and heave you off the cliff any day what a game
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1513.mp3	bit of a middy fed on salt tack and weevilly biscuit talk of giving me rope's end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1514.mp3	once more will you come and let me out no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1515.mp3	to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the middy's waist clenching his hands behind and uttering a sharp whistle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1516.mp3	say mester gurr said dick after one of these searches he wouldn't run away what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1517.mp3	mister raystoke sir don't be a fool
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1518.mp3	what chucked him off yonder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1519.mp3	gurr glanced round to see if the men were looking and then said rather huskily but kindly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1520.mp3	ah ejaculated dick sadly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1521.mp3	say mester gurr sir which thankful i am to you for speaking so but you don't really think as he has come to harm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1522.mp3	i hope not dick i hope not but smugglers don't stand at anything sometimes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1523.mp3	i do assure you there's nothing here but what you may see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1524.mp3	if you'd let me finish you'd know said gurr gruffly one of our boys is missing seen him up here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1525.mp3	boy bout seventeen with a red cap no sir indeed i've not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1526.mp3	don't know as he has been seen about here do you said gurr looking at her searchingly no sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1527.mp3	if she knew evil had come to the poor lad her face would tell tales like print
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1528.mp3	i said a lad bout seventeen in a red cap like yours said gurr very shortly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1529.mp3	the man shook his head and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1530.mp3	here my lad where's your master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1531.mp3	eh i say where's your master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1532.mp3	gurr turned away impatiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp up the steep track leading toward the hoze with the rabbits scuttling away among the furze and showing their white cottony tails for a moment as they darted down into their holes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1533.mp3	i dunno muttered dick and a man can't be sure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1534.mp3	gurr saluted and stated his business while the baronet who had turned sallower and more careworn than his lot drew a breath full of relief one of your ship boys he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1535.mp3	a lad looking like a common sailor and wearing a red cap no said sir risdon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1536.mp3	i have seen no one answering to the description here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1537.mp3	beg pardon sir but can you as a gentleman assure me that he is not here certainly said sir risdon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1538.mp3	surely cried sir risdon excitedly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1539.mp3	sir risdon was silent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1540.mp3	lady graeme looked ghastly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1541.mp3	you do not know no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1542.mp3	i am from the cutter lying off the coast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1543.mp3	don't cry he said i was obliged to come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1544.mp3	and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1545.mp3	i wish you would believe me that i am in as great trouble about it as you are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1546.mp3	that my father sir risdon graeme has smuggled goods here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1547.mp3	he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1548.mp3	pray pray say you will not archy was silent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1549.mp3	then as archy stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1550.mp3	he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured amour propre as the french call our love of our own dignity of which archibald raystoke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1551.mp3	it all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1552.mp3	cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1553.mp3	i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1554.mp3	for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop at nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1555.mp3	no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1556.mp3	the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1557.mp3	to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1558.mp3	the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1559.mp3	next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1560.mp3	yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1561.mp3	no that was too bad he could not do that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1562.mp3	sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hoze were completely gone now and he set his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1563.mp3	a narrow table against the wall in two places
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1564.mp3	he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1565.mp3	but there was no chance for his body there the head would not go first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1566.mp3	a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1567.mp3	lobsters and lobsters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1568.mp3	when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1569.mp3	this question and answer might well go into the primer of information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in san francisco is not a lobster at all but a crayfish

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1626.mp3	when the king entered and saw it he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1627.mp3	the youth promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1628.mp3	at last they came in sight of land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1629.mp3	well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1631.mp3	on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1636.mp3	no one can tell how delighted the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1637.mp3	wilt thou serve me and watch my seven foals asked the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1638.mp3	the youth thought that it was very easy work to watch the foals and that he could do it well enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1639.mp3	hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1640.mp3	yes that i have said the youth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1641.mp3	he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1642.mp3	then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1643.mp3	when he had run after the foals for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with a distaff and she called to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1644.mp3	come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1645.mp3	the youth liked the thought of this let the foals run where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1646.mp3	so there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the livelong day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1647.mp3	on the third day cinderlad wanted to set out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1648.mp3	the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and cinderlad set out on his way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1649.mp3	i am walking about in search of a place said cinderlad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1650.mp3	i would much rather have the princess said cinderlad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1651.mp3	and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1652.mp3	when they had gone thus for a long long way the foal again asked dost thou see anything now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1653.mp3	yes now i see something that is white said cinderlad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1654.mp3	it looks like the trunk of a great thick birch tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1655.mp3	cinderlad tried but could not do it so he had to take a draught from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wield the sword with perfect ease
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1656.mp3	for we are brothers of the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty troll who has cast a spell over us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1657.mp3	when they had travelled a long long way the foal said dost thou see anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1658.mp3	and now inquired the foal seest thou nothing now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1659.mp3	now then said the foal dost thou not see anything now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1660.mp3	that is a river said the foal and we have to cross it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1661.mp3	i have done my best replied cinderlad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1662.mp3	once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1663.mp3	the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1664.mp3	but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1665.mp3	so he asked the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1666.mp3	then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1667.mp3	he is no bigger than other dragons said the tutor and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1668.mp3	then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1669.mp3	only one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1670.mp3	so regin made a sword and sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1671.mp3	then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1672.mp3	so sigurd said that sword would do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1673.mp3	then he saw the track which the dragon made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1674.mp3	but sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit and then he thrust the sword gram right into his very heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1675.mp3	sigurd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1676.mp3	but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1677.mp3	die thou fafnir and then fafnir died
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1678.mp3	then sigurd rode back and met regin and regin asked him to roast fafnir's heart and let him taste of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1679.mp3	so sigurd put the heart of fafnir on a stake and roasted it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1680.mp3	there is sigurd roasting fafnir's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1681.mp3	that let him do and then ride over hindfell to the place where brynhild sleeps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1682.mp3	there must she sleep till thou comest for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1683.mp3	then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was a most beautiful lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1684.mp3	then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1685.mp3	then brynhild's father told gunnar that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and thither they rode and gunnar set his horse at the flame but he would not face it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1686.mp3	for one day when brynhild and gudrun were bathing brynhild waded farthest out into the river and said she did that to show she was guirun's superior
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1687.mp3	for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1688.mp3	not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou will not live long when i am dead

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1690.mp3	the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except the sugar is used in considerable quantities the success is very uncertain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1691.mp3	fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed and be of no service for preserves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1692.mp3	but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1693.mp3	if you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb the tenacity of the syrup will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1694.mp3	let it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1695.mp3	it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1696.mp3	before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar cane

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1698.mp3	boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1699.mp3	the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1700.mp3	from this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup will be easily comprehended
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1701.mp3	they should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1702.mp3	in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1703.mp3	marmalades jams and fruit pastes are of the same nature and are now in very general request
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1704.mp3	marmalades and jams differ little from each other they are preserves of a half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1705.mp3	that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1706.mp3	in all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1707.mp3	confectionary fifteen o eight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1708.mp3	in speaking of confectionary it should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits flowers herbs roots and juices which when boiled with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word conficere to make up but the term confectionary embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1751.mp3	the assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave her courage to look around and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1752.mp3	she gazed accordingly upon a scene which might well have struck terror into a bolder heart than hers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1753.mp3	at his feet was placed a table occupied by two scribes whose duty it was to record the proceedings of the day

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1773.mp3	she meant to be scrupulously conscientious in the administration of her talents and sometimes at church on a sunday when the sermon was particularly awakening she mentally debated the serious question as to whether new bonnets and a pair of jouvin's gloves daily were not sinful but i think she decided that the new bonnets and gloves were on the whole a pardonable weakness as being good for trade
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1774.mp3	one morning laura told her husband with a gay laugh that she was going to victimize him but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1782.mp3	i should so like one to hang in my morning room at jocelyn's rock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1783.mp3	she turned to the french artist presently and asked him where the elder mister kerstall lived and if there was any possibility of seeing him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1784.mp3	they have said that he is even a little imbecile that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1785.mp3	but there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed and that he is still enough harshly critical towards the works of others

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1787.mp3	you will be doing me such a favour philip if you'll say yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1788.mp3	as i thought that this was due to some fault in the earth i wanted to make these first experiments before i undertook my perseus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1789.mp3	when i saw that this bust came out sharp and clean i set at once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the duke after my own plans and design in the house which the duke had given me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1790.mp3	it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceties of art which i had learned so as not to lapse into some error
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1791.mp3	i in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them therefore my lord give me the leave to go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1792.mp3	but beware of letting bandinello quit you rather bestow upon him always more than he demands for if he goes into foreign parts his ignorance is so presumptuous that he is just the man to disgrace our most illustrious school
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1793.mp3	i ask no further reward for my labours up to this time than the gracious favour of your most illustrious excellency
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1794.mp3	then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious folk that i had it in me to execute the promised work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1795.mp3	i had better look to my conduct for it had come to his ears that i relied upon his favour to take in first one man and then another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1796.mp3	i begged his most illustrious excellency to name a single person whom i had ever taken in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1797.mp3	i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words it is true that he lent me a pair of old scales two anvils and three little hammers which articles i begged his workman giorgio da cortona fifteen days ago to fetch back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1798.mp3	giorgio came for them himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1799.mp3	i hope to prove on what account that scoundrel tries to bring me into disgrace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1800.mp3	when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for bernardone who was forced to take flight as far as venice he and antonio landi with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1801.mp3	you had better put this to the proof and i will go at once to the bargello
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1802.mp3	i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since those early days in which i made the medals of pope clement i have learned so much that i can now produce far better pieces of the kind i think i can also outdo the coins i struck for duke alessandro which are still held in high esteem in like manner i could make for you large pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarch king francis of france thanks to the great conveniences he allowed me without ever losing time for the execution of colossal statues or other works of the sculptors craft
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1803.mp3	after several months were wasted and piero would neither work nor put men to work upon the piece i made him give it back

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1805.mp3	now i hope to show them that i am an old sculptor if god shall grant me the boon of finishing my perseus for that noble piazza of his most illustrious excellency

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1847.mp3	he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1848.mp3	his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1849.mp3	in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1850.mp3	they soon elbowed him abruptly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1851.mp3	request courfeyrac to come and talk with me said marius
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1852.mp3	what is to become of you said courfeyrac
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1853.mp3	what are you going to do i do not know

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1855.mp3	you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat and my boots
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1856.mp3	that will be enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1857.mp3	no it is not good what will you do after that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1858.mp3	do you know german no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1859.mp3	it is badly paid work but one can live by it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1860.mp3	the clothes dealer was sent for
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1861.mp3	he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmaker's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1862.mp3	he bought the watch for forty five francs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1863.mp3	hello i had forgotten that said marius
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1864.mp3	the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1865.mp3	i have ten francs left said marius
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1866.mp3	that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1867.mp3	one morning on his return from the law school marius found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistoles that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1868.mp3	marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1869.mp3	at that moment he had three francs left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1870.mp3	but i am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1871.mp3	i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1872.mp3	her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and her humour and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1873.mp3	why did you not send me that news and a garland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1874.mp3	well the best on't is i have a squire now that is as good as a knight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1875.mp3	in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which is strangest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1876.mp3	all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the three s ghosts to reproach me withal and all the kindness his discoveries could make i had for you was laid to my charge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1877.mp3	my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1878.mp3	tis a strange change and i am very sorry for it but i'll swear i know not how to help it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1879.mp3	mister fish is the squire of dames and has so many mistresses that anybody may pretend a share in him and be believed but though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1880.mp3	i think my youngest brother comes down with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1881.mp3	i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabouts they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1882.mp3	but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1883.mp3	i have missed four fits and had but five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1884.mp3	but besides i can give you others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1885.mp3	i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend an interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with their good nature and take it so ill that they are not accepted as i would live in a hollow tree to avoid them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1886.mp3	you will think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1887.mp3	if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may scape it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1888.mp3	well in earnest if i were a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to any one else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so says the justinian wise providence has ordained it that by their different humours everybody might find something to please themselves withal without envying their neighbours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1889.mp3	the matter is not great for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in't upon any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one need care who knows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1890.mp3	if i had a picture that were fit for you you should have it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1891.mp3	how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1892.mp3	i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows the utmost of the injuries you have received from her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1893.mp3	we have had another debate but much more calmly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1894.mp3	and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1895.mp3	i have been studying how tom cheeke might come by his intelligence and i verily believe he has it from my cousin peters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1896.mp3	how kindly do i take these civilities of your father's in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1897.mp3	would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1898.mp3	my poor lady vavasour is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1899.mp3	she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady talmash
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1900.mp3	i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1901.mp3	i never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenance nor ever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons who had time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to please in't but themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1902.mp3	the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1903.mp3	do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1904.mp3	yet in earnest your father will not find my brother peyton wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister than she deserves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1905.mp3	my aunt told me no longer agone than yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome take heed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1906.mp3	you see i give you fair warning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1907.mp3	by the next i shall be gone into kent and my other journey is laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken our intercourse very much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1908.mp3	here are some verses of cowley's tell me how you like them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1909.mp3	i told you in my last that my suffolk journey was laid aside and that into kent hastened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1910.mp3	if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1911.mp3	indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1912.mp3	because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so though i can assure you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1913.mp3	i do not find it though i am told i was so extremely when i believed you loved me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1914.mp3	but i am called upon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1915.mp3	directed for your master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1916.mp3	i see you can chide when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1917.mp3	we dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouths than t'other for fear of overturning it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1918.mp3	you are satisfied i hope ere this that i scaped drowning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1919.mp3	but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed i writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1920.mp3	how welcome you will be but alas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1921.mp3	for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1922.mp3	they laugh to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1923.mp3	we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1924.mp3	well in sober earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonth to gain all that the king has lost unless it were to give it him again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1925.mp3	will you be so good natured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1926.mp3	he has one son and tis the finest boy that e'er you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1927.mp3	you must give me leave to entertain you thus with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1928.mp3	not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss of her aim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1929.mp3	in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1930.mp3	ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things of this nature that i could not forbear laying a peas cod with nine peas in't under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1931.mp3	then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1932.mp3	behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and clashing waves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1933.mp3	hearing this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1934.mp3	upon this he brought me a cotton bag and giving it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and go forth with a company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1935.mp3	do as they do and belike thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1936.mp3	then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1937.mp3	to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and recompense in heaven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1938.mp3	now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1939.mp3	we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1940.mp3	when it was the five hundred and fifty ninth night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1941.mp3	and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at bassorah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1942.mp3	there i abode a little and then went on to baghdad where i entered my quarter and found my house and foregathered with my family and saluted my friends who gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1943.mp3	after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great profit and gain i had made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1944.mp3	next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mohammed the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sindbad the seaman and wished him a good day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1945.mp3	here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1946.mp3	haply amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1947.mp3	presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1948.mp3	but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congealeth on the surface of the water whereby its color and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collect it and sell it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1949.mp3	each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after a little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and abode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1950.mp3	but there is majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1951.mp3	when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1952.mp3	then sighing for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and comorin aloes wood and i bound them together with ropes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the aloes wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1953.mp3	land after land shalt thou seek and find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul in thy thoughts o night all woes shall end or sooner or late
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1954.mp3	i rowed my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried the raft with it down the underground channel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1955.mp3	and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about and my terror and concern for myself lest i should perish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1956.mp3	when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and abyssinians
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1957.mp3	but i was delighted at my escape from the river
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1958.mp3	when they saw i understood them not and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1959.mp3	o my brother answered he we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldst awake at thy leisure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1960.mp3	i answered for allah's sake o my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1961.mp3	when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1962.mp3	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sindbad the seaman continued when i landed and found myself amongst the indians and abyssinians and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1963.mp3	so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1964.mp3	so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1965.mp3	quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on our head and eyes be it for thou gladdenest us with thy company
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1966.mp3	by allah o my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favours and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1967.mp3	then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants aforesaid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1968.mp3	he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah o commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1969.mp3	for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1971.mp3	presently my friends came to me and i distributed presents among my family and gave alms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merry making and forgot all that i had suffered

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1973.mp3	i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1974.mp3	when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/1975.mp3	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sindbad the seaman had related the history of what befel him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sindbad the landsman went home and slept as of wont

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2166.mp3	they did not stay there but walked out across the downs where the skylarks were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and gray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2167.mp3	what's that there said dickie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2168.mp3	if called to a case supposed or suspected to be one of poisoning the medical man has two duties to perform to save the patient's life and to place himself in a position to give evidence if called on to do so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2169.mp3	he should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which food or medicine was last taken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2170.mp3	he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigor mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2171.mp3	in making a post mortem examination the alimentary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2173.mp3	if the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2179.mp3	in using the elastic stomach tube some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked into the aperture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2180.mp3	the tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2185.mp3	this process is based upon the principle that the salts of the alkaloids are soluble in alcohol and water and insoluble in ether
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2186.mp3	the pure alkaloids with the exception of morphine in its crystalline form are soluble in ether

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2192.mp3	five a part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2193.mp3	to purify it add a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid and after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk add a saturated solution of carbonate of potash or soda

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2299.mp3	so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2300.mp3	it warn't funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2304.mp3	evidently the intention was to make things pleasant for the royal foe of tobacco during his visit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2305.mp3	the prohibition in the regulation quoted of smoking in saint mary's church referred it may be noted to the act which was held therein
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2306.mp3	sometimes tobacco was used in church for disinfecting or deodorizing purposes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2307.mp3	blackburn archbishop of york was a great smoker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2308.mp3	on one occasion he was at saint mary's church nottingham for a confirmation

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2310.mp3	parr was such a continual smoker that anyone who came into his company if he had never smoked before had to learn the use of a pipe as a means of self defence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2311.mp3	one sunday says mister ditchfield he had an extra pipe and joshua the clerk told him that the people were getting impatient

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2313.mp3	they have sir replied the clerk

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2316.mp3	david deans however did not at all approve this irreverence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2317.mp3	going to church at hayes in those days must have been quite an exciting experience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2318.mp3	when these men in the course of my remonstrance found that i was not going to continue the custom they no longer cared to be communicants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2319.mp3	then moses was afraid and said surely the thing is known

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2323.mp3	every one who is turbulent has been found by king merneptah the testimony of the oldest biblical narratives regarding the sojourn of the hebrews in egypt is also in perfect accord with the picture which the contemporary egyptian inscriptions give of the period
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2324.mp3	the absence of detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2325.mp3	it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimately coalesced into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2326.mp3	the stories regarding joseph the traditional father of ephraim and manasseh imply that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of benjamin and judah were the chief actors in this opening scene in israel's history
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2327.mp3	the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in egypt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2328.mp3	the later traditions tend to extend the period
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2329.mp3	here were found several inscriptions bearing the egyptian name of the city p atum house of the god atum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2330.mp3	a contemporary inscription also states that he founded near pithum the house of ramses a city with a royal residence and temples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2331.mp3	that the hebrews were restive under this tyranny was natural inevitable

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2334.mp3	the story of moses birth and early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in biblical history
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2335.mp3	was moses justified in resisting the egyptian taskmaster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2336.mp3	is peonage always disastrous not only to its victims but also to the government imposing it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2337.mp3	naturally he went to the land of midian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2338.mp3	the wilderness to the east of egypt had for centuries been the place of refuge for egyptian fugitives
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2339.mp3	from about two thousand b c
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2340.mp3	on the borders of the wilderness he found certain bedouin herdsmen who received him hospitably
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2341.mp3	these sand wanderers sent him on from tribe to tribe until he reached the land of kedem east of the dead sea where he remained for a year and a half
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2342.mp3	later he found his way to the court of one of the local kings in central palestine where he married and became in time a prosperous local prince

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2344.mp3	the story of moses is in many ways closely parallel to that of sinuhit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2345.mp3	the priest of the sub tribe of the kenites received him into his home and gave him his daughter in marriage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2346.mp3	note the characteristic oriental idea of marriage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2347.mp3	here moses learned the lessons that were essential for his training as the leader and deliverer of his people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2348.mp3	after the capture of jericho certain of them went up with the southern tribes to conquer southern palestine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2349.mp3	many modern scholars draw the conclusion from the biblical narrative that it was from the kenites that moses first learned of yahweh or as the distinctive name of israel's god was translated by later jewish scribes jehovah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2350.mp3	do the earliest hebrew traditions imply that the ancestors of the israelites were worshippers of jehovah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2351.mp3	the title of his father in law implies that this priest ministered at some wilderness sanctuary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2352.mp3	moses in the home of the midian priest was brought into direct and constant contact with the jehovah worship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2353.mp3	the cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2354.mp3	his quest was for a just and strong god able to deliver the oppressed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2355.mp3	the wilderness with its lurking foes and the ever present dread of hunger and thirst deepened his sense of need and of dependence upon a power able to guide the destinies of men

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2357.mp3	the constant necessity of meeting the dangers of the wilderness and of defending the flocks entrusted to moses care developed his courage and power of leadership and action

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2359.mp3	an hour after the sun had set the wind fell to a light air that just kept steerage way on the ship

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2363.mp3	at that moment i heard a noise one familiar to seamen that of an oar falling in a boat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2364.mp3	i sang out sail ho and close aboard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2365.mp3	he was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to ascertain what was to be done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2366.mp3	although they went three feet to our two this gave us a moment of breathing time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2367.mp3	as our sheets were all flying forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me leisure to look about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2368.mp3	i soon saw both proas and glad enough was i to perceive that they had not approached materially nearer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2369.mp3	mister kite observed this also and remarked that our movements had been so prompt as to take the rascals aback
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2370.mp3	a breathless stillness succeeded

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2372.mp3	i heard the rattling of the boarding pikes too as they were cut adrift from the spanker boom and fell upon the decks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2373.mp3	kite went aft and returned with three or four muskets and as many pikes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2374.mp3	the stillness that reigned on both sides was like that of death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2375.mp3	the john behaved beautifully and came round like a top
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2376.mp3	the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2377.mp3	the captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instant commanding a dead silence and the closest attention to his orders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2378.mp3	not a soul on board the john was hurt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2379.mp3	on our side we gave the gentlemen the four sixes two at the nearest and two at the stern most proa which was still near a cable's length distant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2380.mp3	they were like the yells of fiends in anguish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2381.mp3	i doubt if we touched a man in the nearest proa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2382.mp3	in this state the ship passed ahead all her canvas being full leaving the proa motionless in her wake

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2450.mp3	during the summer i was either in saint clair jackson or kansas but as there was no robbery committed that summer it makes no difference where i was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2451.mp3	i went through independence and from there to ace webb's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2452.mp3	there i took dinner and then went to doctor l w twyman's

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2456.mp3	we were not on good terms at the time nor have we been for several years

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2463.mp3	i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created by omitting it i will say that at that time i was at neosho kansas with a drove of cattle which i sold to major ray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2464.mp3	it was immediately following the rock island robbery at adair iowa that there first appeared a deliberate enlistment of some local papers in missouri to connect us with this robbery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2465.mp3	i urged on the boys that whatever happened we should not shoot any one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2466.mp3	when miller and i crossed the bridge the three were on some dry goods boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2467.mp3	when we came up i told miller to shut the bank door which they had left open in their hurry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2468.mp3	j s allen whose hardware store was near tried to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and he ran around the corner shouting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2469.mp3	get your guns boys they're robbing the bank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2470.mp3	and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shot in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2471.mp3	almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2472.mp3	chadwell woods and jim rode up and joined us shouting to people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2473.mp3	if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2474.mp3	meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2475.mp3	every time i saw any one with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside but i could not see in every direction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2476.mp3	doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2477.mp3	changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mare
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2478.mp3	what kept you so long i asked pitts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2479.mp3	as to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of a northfield narrator
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2480.mp3	where's the money outside the safe bob asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2481.mp3	the shutters were closed and this caused bunker an instant's delay that was almost fatal pitts chased him with a bullet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2482.mp3	the first one missed him but the second went through his right shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2483.mp3	so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2484.mp3	know o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restoreth to you zau al makan and his sister nuzhat al zaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2485.mp3	when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2486.mp3	zau al makan bowed his head awhile and then said i accept this position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2487.mp3	then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharrkan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2488.mp3	after awhile the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan a conquering host like the full tide sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2489.mp3	when it was the seventy eighth night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2490.mp3	and in it all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2491.mp3	lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau al makan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sire sans peer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2492.mp3	moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dandan call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2493.mp3	he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2494.mp3	replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2495.mp3	but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he is the reciter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2496.mp3	then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2497.mp3	rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2498.mp3	by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2499.mp3	tell me what happened quoth zau al makan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2500.mp3	what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2501.mp3	and he also improvised the two following distichs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2502.mp3	when nuzhat al zaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home then she wept and cried at the eunuch and said to him woe to thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2503.mp3	he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2504.mp3	by allah an thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2505.mp3	but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2506.mp3	return quickly and linger not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2507.mp3	when it was the seventy third night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2508.mp3	but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2509.mp3	now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau al makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and i know him not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2510.mp3	so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or some one i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2511.mp3	then he kissed the eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched a round and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2512.mp3	i say what made my ignomy whate'er the bitter cup i drain far be fro me that land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal me shame
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2513.mp3	then said the eunuch to zau al makan peace be with thee o my lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2514.mp3	o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2515.mp3	we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and return in weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2516.mp3	then the eunuch went out to zau al makan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2517.mp3	and also these
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2518.mp3	then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2519.mp3	when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2520.mp3	after a while they came to themselves and nuzhat al zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2521.mp3	accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the khan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother sharrkan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of buying how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharrkan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2522.mp3	but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2523.mp3	the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girthing his ass and preparing for flight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2524.mp3	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2525.mp3	i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages et about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2526.mp3	why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was thy companion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2527.mp3	but now i will not leave thee between this place and baghdad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2528.mp3	twas as i feared the coming ills discerning but unto allah we are all returning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2529.mp3	then the eunuch cried upon the pages saying take him off the ass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2530.mp3	and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharrkan son of omar bin al nu'uman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in baghdad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2531.mp3	so fare ye forwards no harm shall befal you till you join his grand wazir dandan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2532.mp3	then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2533.mp3	so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharrkan and make him sultan over his father's realm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2534.mp3	and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zau al makan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nuzhat al zaman highs the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for al hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2535.mp3	but scuse me didn't yo figger on doin some detectin an give up fishin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2536.mp3	and shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2537.mp3	i'm going off fishing i may not catch anything i may not want to after i get there

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2539.mp3	and having put himself in a fair way as he hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the darcy case colonel ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in connection with the murder of the east indian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2540.mp3	pinkus and donovan haven't they carroll yep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2541.mp3	carroll was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2542.mp3	are you going to work on that case colonel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2543.mp3	but he hadn't any more to do with it colonel than that cat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2544.mp3	perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2545.mp3	we've got our man and that's all we want
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2546.mp3	you're on the darcy case they tell me in a way yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2547.mp3	i'm working in the interests of the young man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2548.mp3	it's just one of them coincidences like
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2549.mp3	busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2550.mp3	gad exclaimed the colonel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2551.mp3	the very pair i was going to buy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2552.mp3	look here colonel do you know anything about this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2553.mp3	and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2554.mp3	i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of singa phut's shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2555.mp3	now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2556.mp3	phut i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a partner named shere ali
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2557.mp3	anyhow he and phut didn't get along very well it seems
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2558.mp3	neighbors often heard em scrappin a lot and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2559.mp3	toward dark a man went in to buy a lamp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2560.mp3	he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was ali's body with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2561.mp3	sure held so tight we could hardly get it out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2562.mp3	maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the dagos talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were sayin i see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2563.mp3	and the watch have you it yes it's here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2564.mp3	that's the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it going yet see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2565.mp3	you're not as squeamish as all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hand and in a woman's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2566.mp3	and donovan's voice was plainly skeptical
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2567.mp3	yes it may have some rough edges on it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2568.mp3	and i've read enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2569.mp3	if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2570.mp3	before the big wind in ireland suggested thong with a nod at his irish compatriot slightly laughed the colonel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2571.mp3	that's right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2572.mp3	and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a leadpencil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2573.mp3	and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2574.mp3	asked the surprised detective yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2575.mp3	don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2576.mp3	simply because this watch

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2581.mp3	what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2582.mp3	rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2583.mp3	at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2584.mp3	and you i don't want it either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2585.mp3	but i want to know just where we stand now i know

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2588.mp3	in fact i have a feeling that i'll land my fish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2589.mp3	i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks laughed kenneth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2590.mp3	what is it perhaps i can help you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2591.mp3	the old adage of two heads you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2592.mp3	yes it still holds good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2593.mp3	no alimony repeated the colonel puzzled yes just that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2594.mp3	and there's no reason you shouldn't know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2595.mp3	chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2596.mp3	and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel colonel ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2597.mp3	the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2598.mp3	no i wasn't thinking of that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2599.mp3	however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've fished enough for to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2600.mp3	well i don't know that you can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2601.mp3	it isn't generally known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2602.mp3	it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of the baser sort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2603.mp3	you don't mean that larch struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2604.mp3	the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2605.mp3	aaron grafton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2606.mp3	he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2607.mp3	she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2608.mp3	because larch made no defense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2609.mp3	larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2610.mp3	so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2611.mp3	no but he will or i'll sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2612.mp3	and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2613.mp3	still i would like to know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2614.mp3	the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2615.mp3	it had a double reputation so to speak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2616.mp3	grave and even reverend conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2617.mp3	larch himself was a peculiar character
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2618.mp3	in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2619.mp3	and it was this man rich it was said handsome certainly that cynthia ratchford had married
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2620.mp3	to this was the answer whispered money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2621.mp3	and in a way it was true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2622.mp3	she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2623.mp3	after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2624.mp3	then it was said of larch that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brute
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2625.mp3	but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were willing to take a chance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2626.mp3	it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained to the colonel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2627.mp3	meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something be done always returned the answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2628.mp3	don't worry it will come out all right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2629.mp3	i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2630.mp3	it's hard for miss mason too although she's bearing up like a major
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2631.mp3	so king got bail who put it up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2632.mp3	it was high larch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2633.mp3	they took harry away a while ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2634.mp3	but his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2635.mp3	only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2636.mp3	good evening colonel he called genially will you join me in a welsh rabbit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2637.mp3	thank you no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2638.mp3	i'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2639.mp3	now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2640.mp3	the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2641.mp3	there were three of them the center figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2642.mp3	that is not always but sometimes it happened to be so now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2643.mp3	i beg your pardon he said in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2644.mp3	i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2645.mp3	i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2646.mp3	why polonius some one asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2647.mp3	because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2648.mp3	there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency in his pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2649.mp3	it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2650.mp3	i went over them the other day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2651.mp3	that was hers went on the jeweler
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2652.mp3	now harry king has it exclaimed colonel ashley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2653.mp3	it was night outside and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2654.mp3	it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2655.mp3	and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2656.mp3	gordon hit the signal switch and the marspeaker let out a shrill whistle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2657.mp3	guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2658.mp3	you can't do it to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2659.mp3	i'm reformed i'm going straight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2660.mp3	you damned cops can't o'neill was blubbering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2661.mp3	one look was enough the work papers had the telltale over thickening of the signature that had showed up on other papers obviously forgeries
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2662.mp3	some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2663.mp3	when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2664.mp3	jenkins the other cop had been holding the wallet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2665.mp3	must of been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2666.mp3	there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2667.mp3	when gordon and jenkins came back murdoch tossed the money to them split it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2668.mp3	whatever comes to hand gov'nor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2669.mp3	like this social call gordon asked him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2670.mp3	the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober nope
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2671.mp3	you owe me some bills gov'nor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2672.mp3	eleven hundred fifty credits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2673.mp3	you didn't pay up your pledge to the campaign fund so i hadda fill in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2674.mp3	a thousand interest at ten per cent a week standard right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2675.mp3	gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong izzy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2676.mp3	huh izzy turned it over and shook his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2677.mp3	now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2678.mp3	for a second izzy's face went blank then he chuckled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2679.mp3	he pulled out the bills and handed them over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2680.mp3	thanks izzy thanks yourself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2681.mp3	the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2682.mp3	the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2683.mp3	and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2684.mp3	the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2685.mp3	go on accept damn it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2686.mp3	captain murdoch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2687.mp3	but marsport had flourished enough to kill it off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2688.mp3	some of mars laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2689.mp3	the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2690.mp3	even derelicts and failures had to eat there were stores and shops throughout the district which eked out some kind of a marginal living
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2691.mp3	they were safe from protection racketeers there none bothered to come so far out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2692.mp3	the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2693.mp3	captain murdoch was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2694.mp3	the pressure was enough to get them for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2695.mp3	gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2696.mp3	i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2697.mp3	your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graft
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2698.mp3	the first man making a shakedown will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stonewall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2699.mp3	he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2700.mp3	the rest of you can team up any way you want tonight pick any route that's open okay men let's go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2701.mp3	bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdoch's eyes fell on him earth cop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2702.mp3	two years gordon admitted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2703.mp3	for a second gordon cursed himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2704.mp3	he began wondering about security then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2705.mp3	nobody had tried to get in touch with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2706.mp3	there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim phosphor bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2707.mp3	moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2708.mp3	there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2709.mp3	gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2710.mp3	gordon's eyes popped at that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2711.mp3	he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2712.mp3	the other four cops had come in reluctantly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2713.mp3	he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2714.mp3	they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2715.mp3	to find a phone and call the wagon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2716.mp3	we're not using wagons murdoch told him line them up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2717.mp3	if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2718.mp3	murdoch indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2719.mp3	the captain's face was as sick as gordon felt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2720.mp3	i want the name of every man in the gang you can remember he told the man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2721.mp3	colonel they'd kill me i don't know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2722.mp3	murdoch took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched toughs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2723.mp3	if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2724.mp3	trouble began brewing shortly after though
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2725.mp3	murdoch sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2726.mp3	in the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who'd been beaten before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2727.mp3	get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2728.mp3	but the captain stirred finally sighing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2729.mp3	no the cops they're giving me we're covered gordon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2730.mp3	but the stonewall gang is backing wayne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2731.mp3	but it's going to be tough on them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2732.mp3	bruce gordon grimaced i've got a yellow ticket from security
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2733.mp3	murdoch blinked he dropped his eyes slowly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2734.mp3	what makes you think wayne will be re elected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2735.mp3	nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2736.mp3	ever see a martian election
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2737.mp3	no you're a firster he can't lose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2738.mp3	and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2739.mp3	it fitted with the dire predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2740.mp3	he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2741.mp3	cost em more but they'd be respectable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2742.mp3	because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2743.mp3	but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2744.mp3	the groups grew more experienced and murdoch was training a new squad every night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2745.mp3	it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2746.mp3	this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2747.mp3	but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wayne was re elected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2748.mp3	there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2749.mp3	the little publisher was back at the crusader again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2750.mp3	only gordon and sheila were left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2751.mp3	credit had been established again and the businesses were open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2752.mp3	gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2753.mp3	they had been lucky
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2754.mp3	schulberg's volunteers were official now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2755.mp3	fats place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2756.mp3	he reached automatically for the glass of ether needled beer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2757.mp3	thought you'd be in the chips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2758.mp3	that's mars gordon echoed the other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2759.mp3	guess a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hire some bums to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bill this as a real old martian den of sin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2760.mp3	there was a grin on the other's face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2761.mp3	finally got our orders for you it's mercury
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2762.mp3	we sent twenty others the same way and they failed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2763.mp3	let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2764.mp3	you can't stay here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2765.mp3	there's a rocket waiting to transship you to the moon on the way to mercury right now gordon sighed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2766.mp3	and i've paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge she's out shopping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2767.mp3	but his old eyes were glinting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2768.mp3	did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off cobber he asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2769.mp3	i i oh drat it i'm getting old izzy you tell him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2770.mp3	he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzy shook his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2771.mp3	not a sound if you value your lives
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2772.mp3	to offer resistance would have been madness for even hermon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons around them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison near the place of execution
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2773.mp3	was he to be led to the executioner's block
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2774.mp3	what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2775.mp3	ought he not to greet this sudden end as a boon from the immortals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2776.mp3	did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2777.mp3	whatever might await him he desired no better fate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2778.mp3	if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2779.mp3	but if he were destined to meet his myrtilus and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was of finding a joyful reception there from both
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2780.mp3	the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2781.mp3	yet it was no illusion that deceived him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2782.mp3	again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2783.mp3	sometimes with touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2784.mp3	lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2785.mp3	cried hermon in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2786.mp3	to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2787.mp3	daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philippus silenced her with the grave exclamation the order of the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2788.mp3	as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly return the pressure he could not restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2789.mp3	in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2790.mp3	he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the palaestra the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2791.mp3	i love you and have loved you always
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2792.mp3	daphne exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2793.mp3	but hermon with drooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2794.mp3	then daphne raised her face to his asking so the demeter is the work of myrtilus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2795.mp3	what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2796.mp3	and i fool blinded also in mind could be vexed with you for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2797.mp3	bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal and palliate nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2798.mp3	so archias intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2799.mp3	he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2800.mp3	his heart contracted painfully and his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philippus informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by amyntas the rhodian chrysippus and proclus had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2801.mp3	besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2802.mp3	on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2803.mp3	even daphne's image and what threatened her father and her with him receded far into the background
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2804.mp3	he was appearing before his companions only to give truth its just due
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2805.mp3	the egyptian obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festal performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2806.mp3	shouted his friend soteles in joyful surprise in the midst of this painful walk hermon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2807.mp3	even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2808.mp3	honour to myrtilus and his art but he trusted this noble festal assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and aid his prayer for recovery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2809.mp3	when he came from the bath proclus visited him again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2810.mp3	but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor euphranor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2811.mp3	she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2812.mp3	so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2813.mp3	the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2814.mp3	he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2815.mp3	since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescued demeter might yet be the work of myrtilus had again mastered him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2816.mp3	the approval as well as the doubts which it aroused in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2817.mp3	then he went directly to the neighbouring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2818.mp3	hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2819.mp3	when hermon entered the residence of the grammateus in the palace the guests had already assembled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2820.mp3	the place by hermon's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsinoe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2821.mp3	true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2822.mp3	a stranger out of his own sphere he felt chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2823.mp3	crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nico had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsinoe's praises among his professional associates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2824.mp3	his son had been this royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry lysimachus the aged king of thrace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2825.mp3	the king's sister the object of his love cried hermon incredulously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2826.mp3	we women are only as old as we look and the leeches and tiring women of this beauty of forty practise arts which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than her person and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2827.mp3	the three most trustworthy ones are here amyntas the leech chrysippus and the admirable proclus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2828.mp3	let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2829.mp3	your uncle too has often with praiseworthy generosity helped arsinoe in many an embarrassment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2830.mp3	how long he kept you waiting for the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2831.mp3	when he did finally summon you he said things which must have wounded you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2832.mp3	that is going too far replied hermon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2833.mp3	he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsinoe had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eyes had been made in rhodes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2834.mp3	the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2835.mp3	hermon listened to the pair in silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2836.mp3	the rhodian was just beginning to praise arsinoe also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptor's art when crates hermon's fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion why his demeter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2837.mp3	yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2838.mp3	a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2839.mp3	only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose hermon's regard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2840.mp3	how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2841.mp3	though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion ensnares me i can prove
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2842.mp3	it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2843.mp3	there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2844.mp3	margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guest downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2845.mp3	you don't mean that you thought me so silly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2846.mp3	i really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2847.mp3	his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i liked best of all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2848.mp3	you who were always accusing people of being shoppy at helstone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2849.mp3	i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2850.mp3	i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2851.mp3	his father dying in miserable circumstances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2852.mp3	why it might have been in the workhouse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2853.mp3	his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2854.mp3	all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2855.mp3	no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2856.mp3	at least no friend came forwards immediately and missus thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2857.mp3	so they left milton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2858.mp3	how tainted asked her father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2859.mp3	oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2860.mp3	when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2861.mp3	and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2862.mp3	not vicious he never said that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2863.mp3	improvident and self indulgent were his words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2864.mp3	margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2865.mp3	just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2866.mp3	however out it came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2867.mp3	papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2868.mp3	and i do said her father laughing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2869.mp3	personally as you call it and all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2870.mp3	i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2871.mp3	but good night child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2872.mp3	there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2873.mp3	she and dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was her custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2874.mp3	once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2875.mp3	but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2876.mp3	she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2877.mp3	a servant to give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up her whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2878.mp3	visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2879.mp3	one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2880.mp3	well bessy how are you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2881.mp3	better and not better if yo know what that means
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2882.mp3	not exactly replied margaret smiling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2883.mp3	i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o'nights but i'm weary and tired o milton and longing to get away to the land o beulah and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks and i'm no better i'm worse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2884.mp3	margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2885.mp3	but for a minute or two she did not speak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2886.mp3	at last she said in a low voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2887.mp3	bessy do you wish to die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2888.mp3	bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2889.mp3	nought worse than many others i reckon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2890.mp3	but what was it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2891.mp3	you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life at milton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2892.mp3	i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2893.mp3	i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2894.mp3	the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2895.mp3	as they turned up into a small court opening out of a squalid street bessy said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2896.mp3	yo'll not be daunted if father's at home and speaks a bit gruffish at first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2897.mp3	but nicholas was not at home when they entered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2898.mp3	gasped bessy at last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2899.mp3	bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2900.mp3	margaret bent over and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2901.mp3	remember who gave it you and made it what it is

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2903.mp3	but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2907.mp3	but hoo's come at last and hoo's welcome as long as hoo'll keep from preaching on what hoo knows nought about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2908.mp3	it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2909.mp3	but the girl only pleaded the more with margaret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2910.mp3	don't think hardly on him he's a good man he is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2911.mp3	i sometimes think i shall be moped wi sorrow even in the city of god if father is not there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2912.mp3	the feverish colour came into her cheek and the feverish flame into her eye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2913.mp3	but you will be there father you shall oh my heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2914.mp3	she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2915.mp3	margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2916.mp3	presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and bessy roused herself and said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2917.mp3	i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown yo'll come again i know yo will but just say it

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2919.mp3	margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2920.mp3	she was late for tea at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2921.mp3	have you met with a servant dear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2922.mp3	no mamma that anne buckley would never have done

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2924.mp3	everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2925.mp3	i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2926.mp3	what would you do papa how would you set about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2927.mp3	why i would apply to some good house mother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2928.mp3	very good but we must first catch our house mother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2929.mp3	the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2930.mp3	missus thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2931.mp3	i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2932.mp3	perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2933.mp3	she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2934.mp3	my dear said mister hale alarmed pray don't go off on that idea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2935.mp3	i am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2936.mp3	take notice that is not my kind of haughtiness papa if i have any at all which i don't agree to though you're always accusing me of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2937.mp3	i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/test-other/2938.mp3	they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her
