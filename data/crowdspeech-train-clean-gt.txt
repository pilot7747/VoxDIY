https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/80.mp3	i could have talked a long time to such a listener he was so quiet so intense he drank it all in what did you say about me isabel asked i said you were on the whole the finest creature i know

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/84.mp3	by everything but mister goodwood miss stackpole exclaimed with a slightly harsh hilarity isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said did he ask you to speak to me not in so many words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/85.mp3	but his eyes asked it and his handshake when he bade me good bye thank you for doing so and isabel turned away yes you're changed you've got new ideas over here her friend continued i hope so said isabel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/86.mp3	one should get as many new ideas as possible yes but they shouldn't interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones isabel turned about again if you mean that i had any idea with regard to mister goodwood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/87.mp3	but she faltered before her friend's implacable glitter my dear child you certainly encouraged him isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge instead of which however she presently answered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/88.mp3	it's very true i did encourage him and then she asked if her companion had learned from mister goodwood what he intended to do it was a concession to her curiosity for she disliked discussing the subject
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/89.mp3	and found henrietta wanting in delicacy i asked him and he said he meant to do nothing miss stackpole answered but i don't believe that he's not a man to do nothing he is a man of high bold action

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/115.mp3	that man is one of my enemies he has been sent by the band of diamond makers hidden among the mountains to spy on me and if possible prevent me from seeking to discover their secret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/116.mp3	he tried to work on tom's swift's fears and frighten him from using his airship on this quest then when he failed the man must have sneaked into the shed and hidden himself in the ship we must get rid of him or he may wreck the red cloud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/117.mp3	that's so cried tom we must try to capture him i think we had better the lad paused and again listened to the wireless message father says eradicate saw the man have a gun so we must be careful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/118.mp3	the young inventor translated the dots and dashes bless my powder horn exploded mister damon we shall have to proceed cautiously then spoke mister jenks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/119.mp3	if he is like any others in the gang he is a desperate man better sneak up on him then if we can proposed mister parker there are enough of us to cope with one man even if he is armed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/120.mp3	he inquired of tom yes was the hesitating answer but i don't want to use them if i can help it not only because of the danger and a dislike of shedding blood but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/121.mp3	because a stray bullet might pierce the gas bag and damage the ship that's so agreed mister jenks well i guess if we go at it the right way we can capture him without any shooting but we must talk more quietly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/122.mp3	he may have heard us i don't think so replied tom the storeroom is far enough off so that he couldn't hear us besides the motor makes such a racket that he couldn't distinguish what we were talking about even if he heard our voices
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/123.mp3	so unless he heard the wireless working and suspects something from that he probably doesn't know that we are aware of his presence aboard but why do you think he has remained quiet all this while tom asked mister damon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/124.mp3	probably he wants to wait until the ship is farther out west suggested mister jenks then he will be nearer his friends and can get help if he needs it and do you really believe he would destroy the red cloud asked mister parker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/125.mp3	i think that all he is waiting for is a favorable chance declared the diamond seeker he would destroy the craft and us too if he could prevent us from discovering the secret of phantom mountain i believe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/126.mp3	then we must get ahead of him decided tom quietly i have just flashed to dad a message telling him that we will heed his warning now to capture the stowaway
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/127.mp3	and while we're about it give him a good scare when we do get him suggested mister jenks how asked tom threaten to drop him overboard perhaps that will make him tell how he happened to get in our ship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/128.mp3	and what are the plans of the gang of diamond makers we may get valuable information that way i don't believe you can scare such fellows much was tom's opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/129.mp3	how are you going to capture him asked mister parker if he has a gun it won't be any too easy to go in the storeroom and drag him out we'll have to use a little strategy decided tom and then they discussed several plans
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/130.mp3	the one finally adopted was that tom and mister damon should enter the storeroom casually as if in search of food to cook for supper they would discuss various dishes and mister damon was to express a preference for something in the food line
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/131.mp3	the box containing which was well back in the room this would give the two a chance to penetrate to the far end of the apartment without arousing the suspicions of the hidden man who doubtless would be listening to the conversation and as soon as we get sight of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/132.mp3	said tom jump before he has a chance to use his gun mister jenks and mister parker will be waiting outside the room to catch him if he gets away from us i'll have some ropes ready and we'll tie him up and well we'll decide later what to do with him all right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/133.mp3	i'm ready as soon as you are tom said the eccentric man come ahead they went softly to the storeroom and listened at the door there was no sound heard save that made by the machinery i wonder if he's really here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/134.mp3	whispered mister damon we'll soon find out answered tom let's go in they entered and in pursuance of their plan tom and his friend talked of various foods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/135.mp3	i think i'd like some of that canned lobster with french dressing on spoke the eccentric man that's away in the back end of the room said tom in a loud voice it's under a lot of boxes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/136.mp3	then i'll help you get it out bless my frying pan but i am very fond of lobster exclaimed mister damon in as natural tones as was possible under the circumstances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/137.mp3	he and tom moved cautiously back among the boxes and barrels they were glancing about with eager eyes tom switched on an electric light and the instant he did so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/138.mp3	he was aware of a movement in a little space formed by one box which was placed on top of two others the lad saw a dark figure moving as if to get farther out of sight i've got him cried tom making a dive for the shadow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/139.mp3	a moment later the young inventor was bowled over as a dark figure leaped over his head catch him mister damon he cried bless my hatband i i mister damon's voice ended in a grunt he too had been knocked down by the fleeing man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/140.mp3	look out mister jenks cried tom to warn those on guard at the door of the storeroom there was the report of a gun some excited shouts and when tom could scramble to his feet and rush out he beheld mister parker calmly sitting on a struggling man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/141.mp3	while mister jenks held a gun that was still smoking we caught him cried the scientist anybody hurt asked tom anxiously no i knocked up his gun as he fired explained mister jenks where are the ropes tom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/142.mp3	the cords were produced and the man who had now ceased to struggle was tightly bound he uttered not a word but he smiled grimly when mister damon remarked i guess i'll go back in the storeroom tom and see how much food he ate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/143.mp3	he wasn't there long enough well farley munson so it's you is it asked mister jenks as he surveyed the prisoner do you know him asked tom in some surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/144.mp3	he was in with the diamond makers said mister jenks he was one of those who took me to the secret cave but it will be the last time he ever goes there how high up are we tom about two miles why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/145.mp3	i guess that will be far enough to let him fall went on the diamond seeker come on mister damon help me throw him overboard you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/146.mp3	throw me over with the airship two miles high are you gasped the man will you tell us what we want to know if we don't asked mister jenks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/147.mp3	how you got aboard and what your object was in coming that's easy enough i had been hanging around the shed for several days watching a chance to get in finally i saw it when that colored man went to feed his mule and i slipped in and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/148.mp3	hid in the airship the stores were all in then and i stowed myself away among the boxes i had food and water so i didn't touch any of yours and he looked at mister damon who seemed much relieved and what was your object
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/149.mp3	demanded mister jenks i wanted to prevent you from going to phantom mountain how by destroying the airship if need be but i hoped to accomplish it by other means
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/150.mp3	you must keep away from there and if we refuse asked tom then you'll have to take what comes but not from you exclaimed mister jenks we're going to get rid of you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/151.mp3	the man's face showed the alarm he felt oh don't worry said mister jenks quickly we're not going to toss you overboard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/152.mp3	and then go on before you can send any word to your confederates we'll put you off in the most lonesome spot we can find and i guess you'll be some time getting back to civilization by that time we'll have the secret of the diamonds you never will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/153.mp3	declared the man firmly and he would say nothing more though by threats and promises mister jenks tried to get from him something about the men in with him and where the cave of the diamonds was located
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/154.mp3	heavily bound with ropes the man was locked in a small closet to be kept there until a favorable spot was reached for letting him go mister jenks plan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/155.mp3	was considered a good one three days later in crossing over a lonely region near the nebraska national forest farley munson which was one of the names the spy went by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/156.mp3	was dropped off the airship when it was sent down to within a few feet of the earth it will take you some time to get to a telegraph office said mister jenks as a package of food and a flask of water was tossed down to the stowaway
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/157.mp3	he shook his fist at those in the airship and shouted after them you'll never discover the secret of phantom mountain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/158.mp3	rapidly the airship ascended and when it was high over the town of shopton tom headed the craft due west looking down he tried to descry mary nestor in her carriage but the trees were in the way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/159.mp3	their interlocking branches hiding the girl tom did see crowds of other persons though thronging the streets of shopton for though the young inventor had made many flights there was always a novelty about them that brought out the curious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/160.mp3	complimented mister parker is it always as easy as this starting always is was the answer though as the irishman said coming down isn't sometimes quite so comfortable bless my gizzard that's so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/161.mp3	cried the eccentric mister damon can we vol plane to earth in the red cloud tom yes but not as easily as in the butterfly however i hope we will not have to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/162.mp3	now mister damon if you will just take charge of the steering apparatus for a minute i want to go aft what for i wish to see if everything is all right i can't imagine why eradicate was making those queer motions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/163.mp3	mister damon who knew how to operate the red cloud was soon guiding her on the course while tom made his way to the rear compartments through the motor room where the stores of supplies and food were kept he made a careful examination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/164.mp3	looking from an after window and even going out on a small open platform but could discover nothing wrong i guess rad was just capering about without any special object mused tom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/165.mp3	that the colored man had had a method in his madness on his way back through the motor room tom looked to the machinery and adjusted some of the auxiliary oil feeders the various pieces of apparatus were working well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/166.mp3	though the engine had not yet been speeded up to its limit tom wanted it to warm up first everything all right asked mister damon as tom rejoined them in the pilot house which was just forward of the living room in the main cabin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/167.mp3	yes i can't imagine what made rad act that way but i'll set the automatic steering gear now mister damon and then you will be relieved mister jenks was gazing off toward the west
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/168.mp3	to where he hoped to discover the secret of phantom mountain how do you like it asked tom it's great replied the diamond man i've never been in an airship before and it's different than what i expected but it's great
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/169.mp3	it's the only craft that will serve our purpose among the towering mountain peaks where the diamond makers are hidden i hope we can find them in a little while the red cloud was skimming along at faster speed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/170.mp3	guided by the automatic rudders so that no one was needed in the pilot house since there was no danger of collisions airships are not quite numerous enough for that yet though they may soon become so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/171.mp3	tom and the others devoted several hours to arranging their staterooms and bunks and getting their clothing stowed away and when this was done mister parker and mister jenks sat gazing off into space it's hard to realize that we are really in an airship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/172.mp3	observed the diamond man at first i thought i would be frightened but i'm not a bit it doesn't seem as if anything could happen something is likely to happen soon said mister parker suddenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/173.mp3	as he gazed at some weather instruments on the cabin wall bless my soul don't say that cried mister damon what is it i think from my observations that we will soon have a hurricane said the scientific man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/174.mp3	there is every indication of it and he seemed quite delighted at the prospect of his prediction coming true a hurricane cried mister damon i hope it isn't like the one that blew us to earthquake island
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/175.mp3	oh i think there will be no danger spoke tom if it comes on to blow we will ascend or descend out of the path of the storm this craft is not like the ill fated whizzer i can more easily handle the red cloud even in a bad storm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/176.mp3	remarked mister jenks it would be too bad to be wrecked before we got to phantom mountain well i predict that we will have a bad storm insisted mister parker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/177.mp3	and tom could not help wishing that the scientist would keep his gloomy forebodings to himself however the storm had not developed up to noon when tom with mister damon's help served a fine meal in the dining room in the afternoon the speed of the ship was increased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/178.mp3	and by night they had covered several hundred miles through the darkness the red cloud kept on making good time tom got up occasionally to look to the machinery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/179.mp3	and an alarm bell would sound in his stateroom when anything went wrong bless my napkin exclaimed mister damon the next morning as they sat down to a breakfast of fruit ham and eggs and fragrant coffee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/180.mp3	and yet we are how far are we above the earth tom he asked turning to the young inventor about two miles now i just sent her up as i thought i detected that storm mister parker spoke of i told you it would come declared the scientist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/181.mp3	that morning but only the lower edge of it caught the red cloud and when tom sent her up still higher she found a comparatively quiet zone where she slid along at good speed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/182.mp3	that afternoon tom busied himself about some wires and a number of complicated pieces of apparatus which were in one corner of the main cabin what are you doing now asked mister jenks who had been talking with mister parker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/183.mp3	and showing that scientist some of the manufactured diamonds getting our wireless apparatus in shape answered the lad i should have done it before but i had so much to do that i couldn't get at it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/184.mp3	dad will want to know how we are doing as he worked away he also made up his mind to send another message in care of his father for there was a receiving station in the swift home and to whom this message was addressed tom did not say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/185.mp3	but we fancy some of our readers can guess finally after several hours of work the wireless was in shape to send and receive messages tom pulled over the lever and a crackling sound was heard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/186.mp3	as the electricity leaped from the transmitters into space then he clamped the receiver on his ear all ready he announced has anybody any messages they wish sent for with the courtesy of a true host
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/187.mp3	he was ready to serve his guests before he forwarded his own wireless notes just tell my wife that i'm enjoying myself requested mister damon bless my footstool but this is great we're off the earth yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/188.mp3	connected with it mister jenks had no one to whom he wanted to send any word but mister parker wish to wire to a fellow scientist the result of some observations made in the upper air tom noted all the messages down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/189.mp3	and then when all was in readiness he began to call his home station he knew that either his father or mister jackson the engineer could receive the wireless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/190.mp3	but no sooner had the young inventor sent off the first few dots and dashes representing s i his home station call than he started and a look of surprise came over his face they're calling us he exclaimed who is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/191.mp3	asked mister jenks my house my father he he's been trying to get us ever since we started but i didn't have the wireless in shape to receive messages oh i hope it's not too late too late bless my soul too late for what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/192.mp3	gasped mister damon somewhat alarmed by tom's manner the lad did not answer at once he was intently listening to a series of dots and dashes that clicked in the telephone receiver clamped to his left ear on his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/193.mp3	there was a look of worriment father has just sent me a message he said it's a warning flashed through space he's been trying to get it to me since yesterday
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/194.mp3	asked mister jenks rising from his seat the mysterious man is aboard the airship hidden away cried tom that's what eradicate was trying to call to our attention as we started off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/195.mp3	sonya and madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out with him only natasha and the countess remained in the room petya was no longer with the family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/196.mp3	which was making for troitsa the countess on hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natasha pale with a fixed look was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/197.mp3	and paid no attention to her father's words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant three houses off oh how terrible said sonya returning from the yard chilled and frightened i believe the whole of moscow will burn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/198.mp3	there's an awful glow natasha do look you can see it from the window she said to her cousin evidently wishing to distract her mind but natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/199.mp3	and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had been in this condition of stupor since the morning when sonya to the surprise and annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/200.mp3	found it necessary to tell natasha of prince andrew's wound and of his being with their party the countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with sonya
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/201.mp3	paid unceasing attention to her cousin look natasha how dreadfully it is burning said she what's burning asked natasha oh yes moscow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/202.mp3	and as if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her she turned her face to the window looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything and again settled down in her former attitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/203.mp3	but you didn't see it yes really i did natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/204.mp3	nor anything else could seem of importance to natasha the count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when natasha was ill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/205.mp3	then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish and finally kissed her you are cold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/206.mp3	lie down all right i will i'll lie down at once said natasha
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/207.mp3	where was he going how was he wounded was it serious and could she see him but after she had been told that she could not see him that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/208.mp3	evidently disbelieving what they told her and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same all the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/209.mp3	and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving she was planning something and either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/210.mp3	deciding or had already decided something in her mind the countess knew this but what it might be she did not know and this alarmed and tormented her natasha undress darling lie down on my bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/211.mp3	a bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only madame schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor no mamma i will lie down here on the floor natasha replied irritably
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/212.mp3	and she went to the window and opened it through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she put her head out into the damp night air and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/213.mp3	natasha knew it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/214.mp3	the countess exchanged a look with sonya lie down darling lie down my pet said the countess softly touching natasha's shoulders come lie down oh yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/215.mp3	i'll lie down at once said natasha and began hurriedly undressing tugging at the tapes of her petticoat when she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/216.mp3	that had been made up on the floor jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front and began replaiting it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/217.mp3	her long thin practiced fingers rapidly unplaited replaited and tied up her plait her head moved from side to side from habit but her eyes feverishly wide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/218.mp3	when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door natasha you'd better lie in the middle said sonya i'll stay here muttered natasha
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/219.mp3	do lie down she added crossly and buried her face in the pillow the countess madame schoss and sonya undressed hastily and lay down the small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/220.mp3	but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little mytishchi a mile and a half away and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern mamonov's cossacks had set up across the street and the adjutant's unceasing moans
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/221.mp3	could still be heard for a long time natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move first she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/223.mp3	after a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied soon after that natasha heard her mother's even breathing natasha did not move though her little bare foot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/224.mp3	thrust out from under the quilt was growing cold on the bare floor as if to celebrate a victory over everybody a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall a cock crowed far off and another replied near by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/225.mp3	the shouting in the tavern had died down only the moaning of the adjutant was heard natasha sat up sonya are you asleep mamma she whispered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/226.mp3	no one replied natasha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim supple bare feet the boards of the floor creaked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/227.mp3	stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/228.mp3	it was her own heart sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold damp earthen floor of the passage the cold she felt refreshed her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/229.mp3	with her bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay it was dark in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/230.mp3	on which something was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and smoldering wick from the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrew's wound and his presence there natasha had resolved to see him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/231.mp3	she did not know why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/232.mp3	all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see how was he maimed what was left of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/233.mp3	was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutant's yes he was altogether like that in her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified when she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/234.mp3	raised under the quilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stood still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward she cautiously took one step and then another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/235.mp3	and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage another man timokhin was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two others the doctor and a valet lay on the floor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/236.mp3	the valet sat up and whispered something timokhin kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg gazed with wide open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/237.mp3	dressing jacket and nightcap the valet's sleepy frightened exclamation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/238.mp3	horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him she passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she saw prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/239.mp3	and such as she had always seen him he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neck delicate as a child's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/240.mp3	revealed by the turn down collar of his shirt gave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never seen on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexible youthful movement dropped on her knees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/241.mp3	seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of borodino his feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels which were injured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/242.mp3	were in the doctor's opinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning the first night after they left moscow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/243.mp3	had been fairly warm and he had remained in the caleche but at mytishchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/244.mp3	when he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes then he opened them and whispered softly and the tea his remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/245.mp3	he felt prince andrew's pulse and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so a little later with greater suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/246.mp3	timokhin the red nosed major of prince andrew's regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken along with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle of borodino they were accompanied by a doctor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/247.mp3	prince andrew's valet his coachman and two orderlies they gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/248.mp3	i don't want any more is timokhin here he asked timokhin crept along the bench to him i am here your excellency how's your wound mine sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/249.mp3	prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something couldn't one get a book he asked what book the gospels i haven't one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/250.mp3	the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/251.mp3	and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/252.mp3	that came from the wound began examining that dreadful place the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/253.mp3	he kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him what trouble would it be to you he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/254.mp3	he pleaded in a piteous voice the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands you fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/255.mp3	that i wonder how he can bear it by the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under him said the valet the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/256.mp3	was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at mytishchi after growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/257.mp3	and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness and those
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/258.mp3	thoughts though now vague and indefinite again possessed his soul he remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospels that was why he asked for a copy of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/259.mp3	the uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricket chirped from across the passage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/260.mp3	someone was shouting and singing in the street cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on the walls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/261.mp3	his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of feels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/262.mp3	a healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/263.mp3	all the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/264.mp3	it had never reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again yes a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/265.mp3	he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happiness lying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act on man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/266.mp3	every man can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was the son and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/267.mp3	and prince andrew heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating piti piti piti and then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/268.mp3	and ti ti once more at the same time he felt that above his face above the very middle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/269.mp3	to the sound of this whispered music he felt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that this airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/270.mp3	whispered rhythmic music it stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/271.mp3	he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/272.mp3	each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/273.mp3	which also oppressed him but perhaps that's my shirt on the table he thought and that's my legs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/274.mp3	piti piti piti and ti ti and piti piti piti that's enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/275.mp3	for some purpose or for some reason but the love which i while dying first experienced when i saw my enemy and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/276.mp3	now again i feel that bliss to love one's neighbors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/277.mp3	but an enemy can only be loved by divine love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/278.mp3	is he alive when loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred but divine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else can destroy it it is the very essence of the soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/279.mp3	yet how many people have i hated in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i did her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/280.mp3	not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for the first time picturing to himself her soul and he understood her feelings her sufferings shame and remorse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/281.mp3	if only it were possible for me to see her once more just once looking into those eyes to say piti piti piti and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/282.mp3	ti ti and piti piti piti boom flopped the fly and his attention was suddenly carried into another world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/283.mp3	and delirium in which something particular was happening in that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall something was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo was still burning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/284.mp3	but besides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air and a new white sphinx appeared standing at the door and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he had just been thinking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/285.mp3	oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew trying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/286.mp3	but he could not and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched out and the strange face was before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/287.mp3	he moved a little and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/288.mp3	when he came to himself natasha that same living natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him was kneeling before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/289.mp3	he realized that it was the real living natasha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natasha motionless on her knees she was unable to stir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/290.mp3	with frightened eyes riveted on him was restraining her sobs her face was pale and rigid only in the lower part of it something quivered prince andrew sighed with relief smiled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/291.mp3	and held out his hand you he said how fortunate with a rapid but careful movement natasha drew nearer to him on her knees and taking his hand carefully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/292.mp3	just touching it lightly with her lips forgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at him forgive me i love you said prince andrew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/293.mp3	forgive what he asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/294.mp3	broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly just touching it with her lips i love you more better than before said prince andrew lifting her face with his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/295.mp3	so as to look into her eyes those eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidly compassionately and with joyous love natasha's thin pale face with its swollen lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/296.mp3	was more than plain it was dreadful but prince andrew did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful they heard the sound of voices behind them peter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/297.mp3	timokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg had long been watching all that was going on carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench what's this said the doctor rising from his bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/298.mp3	please go away madam at that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed her daughter's absence knocked at the door like a somnambulist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/299.mp3	fell sobbing on her bed from that time during all the rest of the rostovs journey at every halting place and wherever they spent a night natasha never left the wounded bolkonski
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/300.mp3	and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die in her daughter's arms during the journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/301.mp3	as judging by what the doctor said it seemed might easily happen she could not oppose natasha though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/302.mp3	no one least of all natasha and prince andrew spoke of this the unsettled question of life and death which hung not only over bolkonski but over all russia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/303.mp3	the administration of government in its largest sense comprehends all the operations of the body politic whether legislative executive or judiciary but in its most usual and perhaps its most precise signification
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/304.mp3	it is limited to executive details and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department the actual conduct of foreign negotiations the preparatory plans of finance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/305.mp3	the application and disbursement of the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the legislature the arrangement of the army and navy the directions of the operations of war
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/306.mp3	these and other matters of a like nature constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the administration of government the persons therefore to whose immediate management these different matters are committed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/307.mp3	ought to be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate and on this account they ought to derive their offices from his appointment at least from his nomination and ought to be subject to his superintendence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/308.mp3	this view of the subject will at once suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration to reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/309.mp3	the person substituted is warranted in supposing that the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to his measures and that the less he resembles him the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/310.mp3	these considerations and the influence of personal confidences and attachments would be likely to induce every new president to promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/311.mp3	and these causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous mutability in the administration of the government with a positive duration of considerable extent i connect the circumstance of re eligibility
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/312.mp3	the first is necessary to give to the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of his measures and thence to form an experimental estimate of their merits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/313.mp3	the last is necessary to enable the people when they see reason to approve of his conduct to continue him in his station in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues and to secure to the government the advantage of permanency
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/314.mp3	in a wise system of administration nothing appears more plausible at first sight nor more ill founded upon close inspection than a scheme which in relation to the present point has had some respectable advocates i mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/315.mp3	that of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time and then excluding him from it either for a limited period or forever after this exclusion whether temporary or perpetual would have nearly the same effects
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/316.mp3	when they were conscious that the advantages of the station with which it was connected must be relinquished at a determinate period than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/317.mp3	is to make their interests coincide with their duty even the love of fame the ruling passion of the noblest minds which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/318.mp3	and must commit that together with his own reputation to hands which might be unequal or unfriendly to the task the most to be expected from the generality of men in such a situation is the negative merit of not doing harm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/319.mp3	instead of the positive merit of doing good another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to sordid views to peculation and in some instances to usurpation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/320.mp3	an avaricious man who might happen to fill the office looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed would feel a propensity not easy to be resisted by such a man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/321.mp3	to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory though the same man probably with a different prospect before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/322.mp3	might content himself with the regular perquisites of his situation and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of an abuse of his opportunities his avarice might be a guard upon his avarice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/323.mp3	add to this that the same man might be vain or ambitious as well as avaricious and if he could expect to prolong his honors by his good conduct he might hesitate to sacrifice his appetite for them to his appetite for gain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/324.mp3	but with the prospect before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation his avarice would be likely to get the victory over his caution his vanity or his ambition an ambitious man too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/325.mp3	when he found himself seated on the summit of his country's honors when he looked forward to the time at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever and reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/326.mp3	and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess a third ill effect of the exclusion would be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/327.mp3	in the exercise of his office that experience is the parent of wisdom is an adage the truth of which is recognized by the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind what more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/328.mp3	where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation can it be wise to put this desirable and essential quality under the ban of the constitution and to declare that the moment it is acquired its possessor shall be compelled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/329.mp3	to abandon the station in which it was acquired and to which it is adapted this nevertheless is the precise import of all those regulations which exclude men from serving their country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/330.mp3	by the choice of their fellowcitizens after they have by a course of service fitted themselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility a fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men from stations in which
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/331.mp3	in certain emergencies of the state their presence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or safety there is no nation which has not at one period or another experienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/332.mp3	in particular situations perhaps it would not be too strong to say to the preservation of its political existence how unwise therefore must be every such self denying ordinance as serves to prohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/333.mp3	in the manner best suited to its exigencies and circumstances without supposing the personal essentiality of the man it is evident that a change of the chief magistrate at the breaking out of a war or at any similar crisis for another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/334.mp3	even of equal merit would at all times be detrimental to the community inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience and would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of the administration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/335.mp3	a fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be that it would operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration by necessitating a change of men in the first office of the nation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/336.mp3	it would necessitate a mutability of measures it is not generally to be expected that men will vary and measures remain uniform the contrary is the usual course of things

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/339.mp3	but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious object the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/341.mp3	unless the exclusion be perpetual there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage but even in that case may he have no object beyond his present station to which he may sacrifice his independence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/342.mp3	on the arrival of which he not only may but must be exposed to their resentments upon an equal perhaps upon an inferior footing it is not an easy point to determine whether his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an arrangement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/343.mp3	as to the second supposed advantage there is still greater reason to entertain doubts concerning it if the exclusion were to be perpetual a man of irregular ambition of whom alone there could be reason in any case to entertain apprehension

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/345.mp3	there may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the people seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite might occasion greater danger to liberty than could ever reasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/349.mp3	it is a general principle of human nature that a man will be interested in whatever he possesses in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/351.mp3	the inference from it is that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate under a consciousness that in a very short time he must lay down his office will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any material censure or perplexity

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/368.mp3	they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the constitution it may perhaps be asked how the shortness of the duration in office
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/369.mp3	can affect the independence of the executive on the legislature unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the other one answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/370.mp3	though not more conclusive will result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative body over the people which might be employed to prevent the re election of a man who by an upright resistance to any sinister project of that body should have made himself

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/372.mp3	would not for that reason be preferable to a longer period which was at the same time too short for the purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the magistrate it cannot be affirmed that a duration of four years or any other limited duration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/373.mp3	there would always be a considerable interval in which the prospect of annihilation would be sufficiently remote not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of fortitude

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/453.mp3	one side was blank for it had been the last leaf the other contained a verse or two of revelation these words among the rest which struck sharply home upon my mind without are dogs and murderers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/454.mp3	the printed side had been blackened with wood ash which already began to come off and soil my fingers on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word depposed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/455.mp3	i have that curiosity beside me at this moment but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch such as a man might make with his thumb nail that was the end of the night's business

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/457.mp3	and above all in the remarkable game that i saw silver now engaged upon keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means possible and impossible to make his peace and save his miserable life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/458.mp3	he himself slept peacefully and snored aloud yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/459.mp3	there never was such an overturn in this world each of these six men was as though he had been struck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/460.mp3	every thought of his soul had been set full stretch like a racer on that money well he was brought up in a single second dead and he kept his head found his temper and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/461.mp3	here is a narrow corner as
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/462.mp3	his looks were not quite friendly and i was so revolted at these constant changes that i could not forbear whispering so you've changed sides again there was no time left for him to answer in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/463.mp3	and to dig with their fingers throwing the boards aside as they did so morgan found a piece of gold he held it up with a perfect spout of oaths it was a two guinea piece and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/464.mp3	two guineas roared merry shaking it at silver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/465.mp3	you're him that never bungled nothing you wooden headed lubber dig away boys said silver with the coolest insolence you'll find some pig nuts and i shouldn't wonder pig nuts repeated merry in a scream mates do you hear that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/466.mp3	ah merry remarked silver standing for cap'n again you're a pushing lad to be sure but this time everyone was entirely in merry's favour they began to scramble out of the excavation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/467.mp3	darting furious glances behind them one thing i observed which looked well for us they all got out upon the opposite side from silver well there we stood two on one side five on the other the pit between us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/468.mp3	and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow silver never moved he watched them very upright on his crutch and looked as cool as ever i saw him he was brave and no mistake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/469.mp3	at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/470.mp3	one's the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this the other's that cub that i mean to have the heart of now mates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/471.mp3	and plainly meant to lead a charge but just then crack crack crack three musket shots flashed out of the thicket merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/472.mp3	the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side where he lay dead but still twitching and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/473.mp3	before you could wink long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling merry and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony george said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/474.mp3	sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest i tell you but silver was anxious to keep up with us the work that man went through
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/475.mp3	was work no sound man ever equalled and so thinks the doctor as it was he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope doctor he hailed see there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/476.mp3	no hurry sure enough there was no hurry in a more open part of the plateau we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/477.mp3	we were already between them and the boats
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/478.mp3	came slowly up with us thank ye kindly doctor says he you came in in about the nick i guess for me and hawkins
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/479.mp3	i'm ben gunn i am replied the maroon wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment and he added after a long pause how do mister silver pretty well i thank ye says you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/480.mp3	ben ben murmured silver to think as you've done me the doctor sent back gray for one of the pick axes deserted in their flight by the mutineers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/481.mp3	ben in his long lonely wanderings about the island had found the skeleton it was he that had rifled it he had found the treasure he had dug it up it was the haft of his pick axe that lay broken in the excavation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/482.mp3	he had carried it on his back in many weary journeys from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two pointed hill at the north east angle of the island and there it had lain stored in safety since two months
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/483.mp3	given him the stores for ben gunn's cave was well supplied with goats meat salted by himself given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two pointed hill there to be clear of malaria
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/484.mp3	and keep a guard upon the money as for you jim he said it went against my heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/485.mp3	and leaving the squire to guard the captain had taken gray and the maroon and started making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine soon however he saw that our party had the start of him and ben gunn being fleet of foot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/486.mp3	had been dispatched in front to do his best alone then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/487.mp3	not a thought replied doctor livesey cheerily and by this time we had reached the gigs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/488.mp3	this was a run of eight or nine miles silver though he was almost killed already with fatigue was set to an oar like the rest of us and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/489.mp3	and a figure standing by it leaning on a musket it was the squire and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers in which the voice of silver joined as heartily as any three miles farther just inside the mouth of north inlet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/490.mp3	what should we meet but the hispaniola cruising by herself the last flood had lifted her and had there been much wind or a strong tide current as in the southern anchorage we should never have found her more or found her stranded beyond help
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/491.mp3	another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water we all pulled round again to rum cove the nearest point for ben gunn's treasure house and then gray single handed returned with the gig to the hispaniola
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/492.mp3	where he was to pass the night on guard a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave at the top the squire met us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/493.mp3	to me he was cordial and kind saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise at silver's polite salute he somewhat flushed john silver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/494.mp3	replied long john again saluting i dare you to thank me cried the squire it is a gross dereliction of my duty stand back and thereupon we all entered the cave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/495.mp3	it was a large airy place with a little spring and a pool of clear water overhung with ferns the floor was sand before a big fire lay captain smollett and in a far corner only duskily flickered over by the blaze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/496.mp3	i beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold that was flint's treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/497.mp3	how many it had cost in the amassing what blood and sorrow what good ships scuttled on the deep what brave men walking the plank blindfold what shot of cannon what shame and lies and cruelty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/498.mp3	perhaps no man alive could tell yet there were still three upon that island silver and old morgan and ben gunn who had each taken his share in these crimes as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/499.mp3	come in jim said the captain you're a good boy in your line jim but i don't think you and me'll go to sea again you're too much of the born favourite for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/500.mp3	and what a meal it was with ben gunn's salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola never i am sure were people gayer or happier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/501.mp3	the three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught and we thought besides they had had more than enough of fighting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/502.mp3	therefore the work was pushed on briskly gray and ben gunn came and went with the boat while the rest during their absences
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/503.mp3	two of the bars slung in a rope's end made a good load for a grown man one that he was glad to walk slowly with for my part
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/504.mp3	the pictures of all the kings of europe for the last hundred years strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/505.mp3	nearly every variety of money in the world must i think have found a place in that collection and for number i am sure they were like autumn leaves so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/506.mp3	at last i think it was on the third night the doctor and i were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/507.mp3	the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing it was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/508.mp3	all drunk sir struck in the voice of silver from behind us silver i should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/509.mp3	indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all yet i think none treated him better than a dog unless it was ben gunn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/510.mp3	who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster or myself who had really something to thank him for although for that matter i suppose i had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/511.mp3	for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau accordingly it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him drunk or raving said he right you were sir replied silver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/512.mp3	and precious little odds which to you and me i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man returned the doctor with a sneer and so my feelings may surprise you master silver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/513.mp3	but if i were sure they were raving as i am morally certain one at least of them is down with fever i should leave this camp and at whatever risk to my own carcass take them the assistance of my skill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/514.mp3	no said the doctor you're the man to keep your word we know that well that was about the last news we had of the three pirates only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/515.mp3	a council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the island to the huge glee i must say of ben gunn and with the strong approval of gray we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/516.mp3	a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco that was about our last doing on the island
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/517.mp3	and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand with their arms raised in supplication it went to all our hearts i think to leave them in that wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/518.mp3	and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for god's sake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/519.mp3	leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry whipped his musket to his shoulder and sent a shot whistling over silver's head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/520.mp3	after that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance that was at least the end of that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/521.mp3	and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/522.mp3	only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/523.mp3	and as it was what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales we were all worn out before we reached it it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land locked gulf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/524.mp3	the taste of the tropical fruits and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squire taking me along with them went ashore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/525.mp3	to pass the early part of the night here they met the captain of an english man of war fell in talk with him went on board his ship and in short had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the hispaniola
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/526.mp3	silver was gone the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/527.mp3	that man with the one leg had stayed aboard but this was not all the sea cook had not gone empty handed he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/528.mp3	worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/529.mp3	well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mister blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort five men only of those who had sailed returned with her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/530.mp3	as that other ship they sang about with one man of her crew alive what put to sea with seventy five all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly according to our natures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/531.mp3	captain smollett is now retired from the sea gray not only saved his money but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise also studied his profession and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full rigged ship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/532.mp3	married besides and the father of a family as for ben gunn he got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks or to be more exact in nineteen days for he was back begging on the twentieth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/533.mp3	of silver we have heard no more that formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/534.mp3	and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint it is to be hoped so i suppose for his chances of comfort in another world are very small the bar silver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/535.mp3	and the arms still lie for all that i know where flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/568.mp3	and he could still hear the echoes of the startled cries which had come from the men who had threaded through the woods to the up pointed tail fins of the l b now he tried to reason why he had run they were his own kind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/569.mp3	they would take him out of the loneliness of a world heretofore empty of his species but that tall man the one who had led the party into the irregular clearing about the life boat rynch shivered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/570.mp3	dug his nails into the wood on which he lay at the sight of that man dream and reality had crashed together sending him into panic stricken flight that was the man from the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/571.mp3	the man with the cup as his heart quieted he began to think more coherently first he had not been able to find the strong jaws's den
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/572.mp3	then the marks on the ground at the point from which he had fallen and the l b were here just as he remembered but not far from the small ship he had discovered something more a campsite with a shelter fashioned out of spalls and vines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/573.mp3	to go back to the ship clearing was to risk capture but he had to know rynch looked with more attention at his present surroundings deep mold under the trees here would hold tracks there might just be another way to move
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/574.mp3	though it was balled in upon itself he was sure the creature was fully as large as he and the menacing claws suggested it was a formidable opponent when it made no move to follow him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/575.mp3	rynch began to hope it had only been defending its own hiding place for its present attitude suggested concealment still facing that featureless blob in the tree the man retreated alert for the first sign of advance on the part of the creature above
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/576.mp3	none came and he dared to slip around the bole of the tree under which he stood listening intently for any corresponding movement overhead now he was facing that survivor's camp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/577.mp3	another object crouched in the dark of the lean to shelter just as its fellow was on sentry duty in the tree only this one did not have the self color of the foliage to disguise it four limbed its long forearms curved about its bent knees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/578.mp3	and the sense organs of eyes and nose squeezed together on the lower quarter of the rounded portion with a line of wide mouth to split the blunt round of the muzzle dark pits for eyes showed no pupil iris or cornea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/579.mp3	the nose was a black perfectly rounded tube jutting an inch or so beyond the cheek surface grotesque alien and terrifying it made no hostile move and since it had not turned its head he could not be sure it had even sighted him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/580.mp3	but it knew he was there he was certain of that and was waiting for what as the long seconds crawled by rynch began to believe that it was not waiting for him heartened he pulled at the vine loop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/581.mp3	climbed back into the tree minutes later he discovered that there were more than two of the beasts waiting quietly about the camp and that their sentry line ran between him and the clearing of the l b he withdrew farther into the wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/582.mp3	intent upon finding a detour which would bring him out into the open lands now he wanted to join forces with his own kind whether those men were potential enemies or not as time passed the beasts closed about the clearing of the camp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/583.mp3	afternoon was fading into evening when he reached a point several miles downstream near the river since he had come into the open he had not sighted any of the watchers he hoped they did not willingly venture out of the trees where the leaves were their protection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/584.mp3	rynch went flat on the stream bank made a worm's progress up the slope to crouch behind a bush and survey the land immediately ahead there stood an off world spacer fins down nose skyward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/585.mp3	and grouped not too far from its landing ramp a collection of bubble tents a fire burned in their midst and men were moving about it now that he was free from the wood and its watchers and had come so near to his goal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/586.mp3	rynch was curiously reluctant to do the sensible thing to rise out of concealment and walk up to that fire to claim rescue by his own kind the man he sought stood by the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/587.mp3	shrugging his arms into a webbing harness which brought a box against his chest having made that fast he picked up a needler by its sling by their gestures the others were arguing with him but he shook his head came on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/588.mp3	that idea made sense and in the meantime he would let the other past him follow along behind until he was far enough from the camp so that his friends could not interfere then they would have a meeting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/589.mp3	in spite of his caution rynch was close to betrayal as he edged around a clump of vegetation growing half in half out of the stream only a timely rustle told him that the other had sat down on a drift log waiting for him rynch froze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/590.mp3	so startled that he could not think clearly for a second then he noted that the outline of the other's body was visible growing brighter by the moment minute particles of pale greenish radiance were gathering about the other the dark shadow of an arm flapped the radiance swirled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/591.mp3	but they no longer gathered in strength enough to light his presence now he could see they drifted about the vegetation about the log where the man sat about rocks and reeds only they were thicker about the stranger as if his body were a magnet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/592.mp3	he continued to keep them whirling by means of waving hand and arm but there was enough light to show rynch the fingers of his other hand busy on the front panel of the box he wore that fingering stopped then rynch's head came up as he heard a very faint sound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/593.mp3	not a beast's cry or was it again those fingers moved on the panel was the other sending a message by that means rynch watched him check the webbing count the equipment at his belt settle the needler in the crook of his arm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/594.mp3	however the other was as wary of that dark as if he suspected what might lie in wait there he angled along northward avoiding clumps of scattered brush keeping in the open where rynch dared not tail him too closely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/595.mp3	their course parallel to the woods brought them at last to a second stream the size of a river into which the first creek emptied here the other settled down between two rocks with every indication of remaining there for a period
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/596.mp3	thankfully rynch found his own lurking place from which he could keep the other in sight the light points gathered hung in a small luminous cloud over the rocks but rynch had prudently withdrawn under a bush
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/597.mp3	and the scent of its aromatic leaves must have discouraged the sparks for no such crown came to his sentry post drugged with fatigue the younger man slept awaking to full day a fog of bewilderment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/598.mp3	what was the purpose of the other's expedition was he going to use the open cut through which the river ran as a way of penetrating the wooded country now rynch considered the problem from his own angle the man from the spacer had made no effort to conceal his trail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/599.mp3	in fact it would almost seem that he had deliberately gone out of his way to leave boot prints on favorable stretches of ground did he guess that rynch lurked behind was now leading him on for some purpose of his own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/600.mp3	or were those traces left to guide another party from the camp to advance openly up the stream bed was to invite discovery rynch surveyed the nearer bank clumps of small trees and high growing bushes dotted that expanse an ideal cover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/601.mp3	that sound of snarling spitting hate ended in mid cry as rynch crawled to the river bank the man from the spacer camp had been the focus of a three prong attack from a female and her cubs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/602.mp3	three red bodies were flat and still on the gravel as the off worlder leaned back against a rock breathing heavily as rynch sighted him he stooped to recover the needler he had dropped lurched away from the rock towards the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/603.mp3	clawed at the ground about him already he was buried to his knees then his mid thighs in the artificial quicksand but he had not lost his head and was jerking from side to side in an effort to pull free rynch got to his feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/604.mp3	walked with slow deliberation down to the river's brink the trapped prisoner had shied halfway around stretching out his arms to find a firmer grip on some rock large and heavy enough to anchor him after his first startled cry he had made no sound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/605.mp3	but now as he sighted rynch his eyes widened and his lips parted the box on his chest caught on a stone he had dragged to him in a desperate try for support
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/606.mp3	there was a spitting of sparks and the stranger worked frantically at the buckle of the webbing harness to loosen it and toss the whole thing from him the box struck one of the dead water cats flashed as fur and flesh were singed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/607.mp3	rynch watched dispassionately before he caught the needler jerking it away from the prisoner the man eyed him steadily and his expression did not alter even when rynch swung the off world weapon to center its sights on the late owner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/608.mp3	suppose rynch's voice was rusty sounding in his own ears we talk now the man nodded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/609.mp3	and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile there an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminum car the tackle belonging to the crane being hauled from outside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/610.mp3	nicholl once introduced with his companions inside the projectile began to close the opening by means of a strong plate held in position by powerful screws other plates closely fitted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/611.mp3	covered the lenticular glasses and the travelers hermetically enclosed in their metal prison were plunged in profound darkness and now my dear companions said michel ardan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/612.mp3	gas was not invented for moles so saying the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the sole of his boot and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle in which the carbonized hydrogen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/613.mp3	stored at high pressure sufficed for the lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty four hours or six days and six nights the gas caught fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/614.mp3	and thus lighted the projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly padded walls furnished with a circular divan and a roof rounded in the shape of a dome michel ardan examined everything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/615.mp3	you smile barbicane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/616.mp3	do you say to yourself this prison may be our tomb tomb perhaps still i would not change it for mahomet's which floats in space but never advances an inch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/617.mp3	while michel ardan was speaking barbicane and nicholl were making their last preparations nicholl's chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten p m when the three travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/618.mp3	this chronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of murchison the engineer barbicane consulted it my friends said he it is twenty minutes past ten at forty seven minutes past ten
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/619.mp3	murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire which communicates with the charge of the columbiad at that precise moment we shall leave our spheroid thus we still have twenty seven minutes to remain on the earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/620.mp3	well exclaimed michel ardan in a good humored tone much may be done in twenty six minutes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/621.mp3	well twenty four if you like my noble captain said ardan twenty four minutes in which to investigate michel said barbicane during the passage we shall have plenty of time to investigate the most difficult questions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/622.mp3	for the present we must occupy ourselves with our departure are we not ready doubtless but there are still some precautions to be taken to deaden as much as possible the first shock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/623.mp3	have we not the water cushions placed between the partition breaks whose elasticity will sufficiently protect us i hope so michel replied barbicane gently but i am not sure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/624.mp3	asked barbicane humph said michel ardan it is not easy we are in the train and the guard's whistle will sound before twenty four minutes are over twenty said nicholl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/625.mp3	for some moments the three travelers looked at each other then they began to examine the objects imprisoned with them everything is in its place said barbicane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/626.mp3	we have now to decide how we can best place ourselves to resist the shock position cannot be an indifferent matter and we must as much as possible prevent the rush of blood to the head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/627.mp3	no said barbicane let us stretch ourselves on our sides we shall resist the shock better that way remember that when the projectile starts it matters little whether we are in it or before it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/628.mp3	replied the captain we've still thirteen minutes and a half that nicholl is not a man exclaimed michel he is a chronometer with seconds an escape and eight holes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/629.mp3	we might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these americans made to whom the approach of the most frightful danger added no pulsation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/630.mp3	three thick and solidly made couches had been placed in the projectile nicholl and barbicane placed them in the center of the disc forming the floor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/631.mp3	there the three travelers were to stretch themselves some moments before their departure during this time ardan not being able to keep still turned in his narrow prison like a wild beast in a cage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/632.mp3	chatting with his friends speaking to the dogs diana and satellite to whom as may be seen he had given significant names ah diana ah satellite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/633.mp3	he exclaimed teasing them so you are going to show the moon dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth that will do honor to the canine race if ever we do come down again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/634.mp3	i will bring a cross type of moon dogs which will make a stir if there are dogs in the moon said barbicane there are said michel ardan just as there are horses cows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/635.mp3	donkeys and chickens i bet that we shall find chickens a hundred dollars we shall find none said nicholl done my captain replied ardan clasping nicholl's hand but by the bye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/636.mp3	thirty seven minutes six seconds past ten it is understood captain well before another quarter of an hour you will have to count nine thousand dollars to the president
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/637.mp3	four thousand because the columbiad will not burst and five thousand because the projectile will rise more than six miles in the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/638.mp3	i only ask to be allowed to pay come nicholl i see that you are a man of method which i could never be but indeed you have made a series of bets of very little advantage to yourself allow me to tell you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/639.mp3	and why asked nicholl because if you gain the first the columbiad will have burst and the projectile with it and barbicane will no longer be there to reimburse your dollars my stake is deposited at the bank in baltimore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/640.mp3	replied barbicane simply and if nicholl is not there it will go to his heirs ah you practical men exclaimed michel ardan i admire you the more for not being able to understand you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/641.mp3	at the bottom of a gun nine hundred feet long and under this projectile are rammed four hundred thousand pounds of gun cotton which is equal to one million six hundred thousand pounds of ordinary powder and friend murchison
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/642.mp3	his eye fixed on the needle his finger on the electric apparatus is counting the seconds preparatory to launching us into interplanetary space enough michel enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/643.mp3	said barbicane in a serious voice let us prepare
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/644.mp3	one clasp of the hand my friends yes exclaimed michel ardan more moved than he wished to appear and the three bold companions were united in a last embrace god preserve us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/645.mp3	barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down by his companions and the profound silence was only broken by the ticking of the chronometer marking the seconds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/646.mp3	they had undergone a remarkable change since our arrival at the butcher's shop they now wandered about fat sleek and contented and their former voracity had completely disappeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/647.mp3	as regards ourselves a day or two longer made no difference our most important article of diet the pemmican was practically left untouched as for the time being dog had completely taken its place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/648.mp3	there was thus no great sign of depression to be noticed when we came back into the tent after finishing our work and had to while away the time as i went in i could descry wisting a little way off kneeling on the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/649.mp3	and engaged in the manufacture of cutlets the dogs stood in a ring round him and looked on with interest the north east wind whistled and howled the air was thick with driving snow and wisting was not to be envied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/650.mp3	to whatever age i may live in the course of the night the wind had gone back to the north and increased to a gale it was blowing and snowing so that when we came out in the morning we could not see the sledges they were half snowed under
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/651.mp3	the temperature was not so very low
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/652.mp3	we had all taken a turn outside to look at the weather and were sitting on our sleeping bags discussing the poor prospect it's the devil's own weather here at the butcher's said one it looks to me as if it would never get any better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/653.mp3	this is the fifth day and it's blowing worse than ever we all agreed there's nothing so bad as lying weather bound like this continued another it takes more out of you than going from morning to night personally i was of the same opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/654.mp3	one day may be pleasant enough but two three four
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/655.mp3	no it was awful shall we try it no sooner was the proposal submitted than it was accepted unanimously and with acclamation when i think of my four friends of the southern journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/656.mp3	it is the memory of that morning that comes first to my mind all the qualities that i most admire in a man were clearly shown at that juncture courage and dauntlessness without boasting or big words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/657.mp3	amid joking and chaff everything was packed and then out into the blizzard it was practically impossible to keep one's eyes open the fine drift snow penetrated everywhere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/658.mp3	the dogs were not much inclined to start and it took time to get them into their harness but at last we were ready one more glance over the camping ground to see that nothing we ought to have with us had been forgotten
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/659.mp3	which we now thought would not be required were left behind the last thing to be done was planting a broken ski upright by the side of the depot it was wisting who did this thinking presumably that an extra mark would do no harm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/660.mp3	that it was a happy thought the future will show and then we were off it was a hard pull to begin with both for men and beasts as the high sastrugi continued towards the south
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/661.mp3	and made it extremely difficult to advance those who had sledges to drive had to be very attentive and support them so that they did not capsize on the big waves and we who had no sledges found great difficulty in keeping our feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/662.mp3	as we had nothing to lean against we went on like this slowly enough but the main thing was that we made progress the ground at first gave one the impression of rising though not much the going was extremely heavy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/663.mp3	it was like dragging oneself through sand meanwhile the sastrugi grew smaller and smaller and finally they disappeared altogether and the surface became quite flat the going also improved by degrees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/664.mp3	for what reason it is difficult to say as the storm continued unabated and the drift now combined with falling snow was thicker than ever it was all the driver could do to see his own dogs the surface
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/665.mp3	which had become perfectly level had the appearance at times of sinking in any case one would have thought so from the pace of the sledges now and again the dogs would set off suddenly at a gallop the wind aft no doubt helped the pace somewhat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/666.mp3	but it alone could not account for the change i did not like this tendency of the ground to fall away in my opinion we ought to have done with anything of that sort after reaching the height at which we were a slight slope upward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/667.mp3	possibly but down no that did not agree with my reckoning so far the incline had not been so great as to cause uneasiness but if it seriously began to go downhill we should have to stop and camp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/668.mp3	would be madness we might risk falling into some chasm before we had time to pull up hanssen as usual was driving first strictly speaking i should now have been going in advance but the uneven surface at the start
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/669.mp3	and the rapid pace afterwards had made it impossible to walk as fast the dogs could pull i was therefore following by the side of wisting's sledge and chatting with him suddenly i saw hanssen's dogs shoot ahead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/670.mp3	and downhill they went at the wildest pace wisting after them i shouted to hanssen to stop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/671.mp3	by twisting his sledge the others who were following stopped when they came up to him we were in the middle of a fairly steep descent what there might be below was not easy to decide nor would we try to find out in that weather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/672.mp3	we trampled down a place for the tent in the loose snow and soon got it up it was not a long day's march that we had done eleven and three quarter miles but we had put an end to our stay at the butcher's shop and that was a great thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/673.mp3	the boiling point test that evening showed that we were ten thousand three hundred feet above the sea and that we had thus gone down six hundred twenty feet from the butcher's we turned in and went to sleep as soon as it brightened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/674.mp3	one has to seize every opportunity in these regions if one neglects to do so it may mean a long wait and much may be lost we therefore all slept with one eye open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/675.mp3	and we knew well that nothing could happen without our noticing it at three in the morning the sun cut through the clouds and we through the tent door to take in the situation was more than the work of a moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/676.mp3	the sun showed as yet like a pat of butter and had not succeeded in dispersing the thick mists the wind had dropped somewhat but was still fairly strong this is after all the worst part of one's job
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/677.mp3	turning out of one's good warm sleeping bag and standing outside for some time in thin clothes watching the weather we knew by experience that a gleam like this a clearing in the weather might come suddenly and then one had to be on the spot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/678.mp3	the gleam came it did not last long but long enough we lay on the side of a ridge that fell away pretty steeply the descent on the south was too abrupt but on the south east it was better and more gradual
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/679.mp3	and ended in a wide level tract we could see no crevasses or unpleasantness of any kind it was not very far that we could see though only our nearest surroundings of the mountains we saw nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/680.mp3	had now broken loose again and the north easter was doing all it could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/681.mp3	since we had discovered the nature of our immediate surroundings if we once got down to the plain we knew that we could always feel our way on after putting ample brakes on the sledge runners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/682.mp3	we started off downhill in a south easterly direction the slight idea of the position that we had been able to get in the morning proved correct the descent was easy and smooth and we reached the plain without any adventure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/683.mp3	we could now once more set our faces to the south and in thick driving snow we continued our way into the unknown with good assistance from the howling north easterly gale we now recommenced the erection of beacons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/684.mp3	which had not been necessary during the ascent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/685.mp3	the last of them that we encountered the surface was now fine enough smooth as a floor and without a sign of sastrugi if our progress was nevertheless slow and difficult this was due to the wretched going
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/686.mp3	which was real torture to all of us a sledge journey through the sahara could not have offered a worse surface to move over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/687.mp3	the weather improved in the course of the day and when we camped in the afternoon it looked quite smiling the sun came through and gave a delightful warmth after the last few bitter days it was not yet clear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/688.mp3	so that we could see nothing of our surroundings the distance according to our three sledge meters was eighteen and a half miles taking the bad going into consideration we had reason to be well satisfied with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/689.mp3	our altitude came out at nine thousand four hundred seventy five feet above the sea or a drop of eight hundred twenty five feet in the course of the day this surprised me greatly what did it mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/690.mp3	instead of rising gradually we were going slowly down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/691.mp3	but what according to dead reckoning our latitude that evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/692.mp3	the night was filled with sharp gusts from the north the morning came with a slack wind but accompanied by mist and snowfall this was abominable here we were advancing over absolutely virgin ground and able to see nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/693.mp3	the surface remained about the same possibly rather more undulating that it had been blowing here at some time and violently too was shown by the under surface which was composed of sastrugi as hard as iron
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/694.mp3	luckily for us the snowfall of the last few days had filled these up so as to present a level surface it was heavy going though better than on the previous day as we were advancing still blindly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/695.mp3	and fretting at the persistently thick weather one of us suddenly called out hullo look there a wild dark summit rose high out of the mass of fog to the east south east it was not far away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/696.mp3	on the contrary it seemed threateningly near and right over us we stopped and looked at the imposing sight but nature did not expose her objects of interest for long the fog rolled over again thick heavy and dark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/697.mp3	and blotted out the view we knew now that we had to be prepared for surprises after we had gone about ten miles the fog again lifted for a moment and we saw quite near a mile or so away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/698.mp3	two long narrow mountain ridges to the west of us running north and south and completely covered with snow these
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/699.mp3	they were between nine thousand and ten thousand feet high and would probably serve as excellent landmarks on the return journey there was no connection to be traced between these mountains and those lying to the east of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/700.mp3	they gave us the impression of being entirely isolated summits as we could not make out any lofty ridge running east and west
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/701.mp3	we continued our course in the constant expectation of finding some surprise or other in our line of route the air ahead of us was as black as pitch as though it concealed something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/702.mp3	it could not be a storm or it would have been already upon us but we went on and on and nothing came our day's march was eighteen and a half miles i see that my diary for november twenty eighth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/703.mp3	does not begin very promisingly fog fog and again fog also fine falling snow which makes the going impossible poor beasts they have toiled hard to get the sledges forward to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/704.mp3	but the day did not turn out so badly after all as we worked our way out of this uncertainty and found out what was behind the pitch dark clouds during the forenoon the sun came through and thrust aside the fog for a while and there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/705.mp3	to the south east not many miles away lay an immense mountain mass from this mass right across our course ran a great ancient glacier the sun shone down upon it and showed us a surface full of huge irregularities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/706.mp3	on the side nearest to the mountain these disturbances were such that a hasty glance was enough to show us the impossibility of advancing that way but right in our line of route straight on to the glacier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/707.mp3	and waited for decently clear weather so that we might survey the ground at our ease and choose the best way going forward without an idea of what the ground was like was not very pleasant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/708.mp3	but how long should we have to wait for clear weather that question was unanswerable possibly a week or even a fortnight and we had no time for that better go straight on then and take what might come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/709.mp3	what we could see of the glacier appeared to be pretty steep but it was only between the south and south east under the new land that the fog now and again lifted sufficiently to enable us to see anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/710.mp3	we could see that the big crevasses lost themselves in it and the question of what the glacier looked like on the west
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/711.mp3	it was plain enough that we should have stiff work it was therefore important to have as little as possible on the sledges we set to work at once to build the depot the snow here was excellent for this purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/712.mp3	as hard as glass in a short time an immense erection of adamantine blocks of snow rose into the air containing provisions for five men for six days and for eighteen dogs for five days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/713.mp3	a number of small articles were also left behind while we were thus occupied the fog had been coming and going some of the intervals had been quite clear and had given me a good view of the nearest part of the range
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/714.mp3	it appeared to be quite isolated and to consist of four mountains one of these mount helmer hanssen lay separated from the rest the other three mounts oscar wisting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/715.mp3	and olav bjaaland lay closer together behind this group the air had been heavy and black the whole time showing that more land must be concealed there suddenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/716.mp3	and the summits of a colossal mountain mass appeared our first impression was that this mountain mount thorvald nilsen must be something over twenty thousand feet high it positively took our breath away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/717.mp3	so formidable did it appear but it was only a glimpse that we had and then the fog enclosed it once more we had succeeded in taking a few meagre bearings of the different summits of the nearest group
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/718.mp3	they were not very grand but better ones were not to be obtained for that matter the site of the depot was so well marked by its position under the foot of the glacier that we agreed it would be impossible to miss it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/719.mp3	having finished the edifice which rose at least six feet into the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/720.mp3	so as to be able to see it still more easily on the way back an observation we had contrived to take while the work was in progress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/721.mp3	this did not agree very well with the latitude of our dead reckoning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/722.mp3	and a fine light snow was falling we had taken a bearing of the line of glacier that was most free of crevasses and so we moved on again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/723.mp3	the crevasses at its foot were not large but we had no sooner entered upon the ascent than the fun began there was something uncanny about this perfectly blind advance among crevasses and chasms on all sides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/724.mp3	we examined the compass from time to time and went forward cautiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/725.mp3	but that after all was not much of a help to our drivers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/726.mp3	as the crevasses were often rendered quite invisible by a thin overlying layer of snow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/727.mp3	to have to cross such a surface as the effect of light and shade is usually to show up the edges of these insidious pitfalls but on a day like this when everything looked alike one's advance is doubtful we kept it going however
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/728.mp3	by using the utmost caution wisting came near to sounding the depth of one of these dangerous crevasses with sledge dogs and all as the bridge he was about to cross gave way thanks to his presence of mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/729.mp3	and a lightning like movement some would call it luck he managed to save himself in this way we worked up about two hundred feet but then we came upon such a labyrinth of yawning chasms and open abysses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/730.mp3	that we could not move there was nothing to be done but to find the least disturbed spot and set the tent there as soon as this was done hanssen and i set out to explore we were roped and therefore safe enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/731.mp3	it required some study to find a way out of the trap we had run ourselves into towards the group of mountains last described which now lay to the east of us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/732.mp3	in all directions and evoked a picture of violent confusion thank god we were not here while this was going on i thought to myself as i stood looking out over this battlefield it must have been a spectacle like doomsday
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/733.mp3	and not on a small scale either to advance in that direction then was hopeless but that was no great matter since our way was to the south on the south we could see nothing the fog lay thick and heavy there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/734.mp3	this ridge led us on to an icewave about twenty five feet high a formation which was due to the pressure having ceased before the wave had been forced to break and form hummocks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/735.mp3	we saw well enough that this would be a difficult place to pass with sledges and dogs but in default of anything better it would have to be done from the top of this wave formation we could see down on the other side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/736.mp3	which had hitherto been hidden from us the fog prevented our seeing far but the immediate surroundings were enough to convince us that with caution we could beat up farther from the height on which we stood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/737.mp3	as we saw absolutely nothing our object was to make tracks for the following day's journey the language we used about the glacier as we went was not altogether complimentary we had endless tacking and turning to get on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/738.mp3	a fissure had opened making a gateway about six feet wide this formation like every thing else on the glacier was obviously very old and for the most part filled with snow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/739.mp3	from this point the glacier as far as our view extended to the south looked better and better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/740.mp3	our companions were no less pleased with the news we brought of our prospects our altitude that evening was eight thousand six hundred fifty feet above the sea that is to say at the foot of the glacier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/741.mp3	we had reached an altitude of eight thousand four hundred fifty feet or a drop from the butcher's of two thousand five hundred seventy feet we now knew very well that we should have this ascent to make again perhaps even more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/742.mp3	and this idea did not arouse any particular enthusiasm in my diary i see that i conclude the day with the following words what will the next surprise be i wonder it was in fact
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/743.mp3	an extraordinary journey that we were undertaking through new regions new mountains glaciers and so on without being able to see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/744.mp3	what i liked least about this feeling one's way forward in the dark was that it would be difficult very difficult indeed to recognize the ground again on the way back but with this glacier lying straight across our line of route
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/745.mp3	a mistake there might be serious enough and it will appear later in this narrative that my fear of our not being able to recognize the way was not entirely groundless the beacons we had put up came to our aid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/746.mp3	and for our final success we owe a deep debt of gratitude to our prudence and thoughtfulness in adopting this expedient next morning november twenty ninth brought considerably clearer weather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/747.mp3	and allowed us a very good survey of our position we could now see that the two mountain ranges
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/748.mp3	with summits from ten thousand to fifteen thousand feet mount thorvald nilsen was the most southerly we could see from this point mounts hanssen wisting bjaaland and hassel formed as we had thought the day before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/749.mp3	a group by themselves and lay separated from the main range the drivers had a warm morning's work they had to drive with great circumspection and patience to grapple with the kind of ground we had before us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/750.mp3	a slight mistake might be enough to send both sledge and dogs with lightning rapidity into the next world it took nevertheless a remarkably short time to cover the distance we had explored on the previous evening before we knew it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/751.mp3	we were at hell's gate bjaaland took an excellent photograph here which gives a very good idea of the difficulties this part of the journey presented in the foreground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/752.mp3	below the high snow ridge that forms one side of a very wide but partly filled up crevasse the marks of ski can be seen in the snow this was the photographer who in passing over this snow bridge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/753.mp3	struck his ski into it to try the strength of the support close to the tracks can be seen an open piece of the crevasse it is a pale blue at the top but ends in the deepest black in a bottomless abyss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/754.mp3	the photographer got over the bridge and back with a whole skin but there could be no question of risking sledges and dogs on it and it can be seen in the photograph that the sledges have been turned right round to try another way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/755.mp3	but taking into account all the turns and circuits we had been compelled to make it was not so short after all we set our tent on a good solid foundation and were well pleased with the day's work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/756.mp3	the altitude was eight thousand nine hundred sixty feet above the sea the sun was now in the west and shining directly upon the huge mountain masses it was a fairy landscape in blue and white
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/757.mp3	clear as it now appeared to be one could understand that the weather was not all that could be wished for the south eastern end of mount thorvald nilsen lost itself in a dark impenetrable cloud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/758.mp3	which led one to suspect a continuation in that direction though one could not be certain mount nilsen ah anything more beautiful taking it altogether i have never seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/759.mp3	peaks of the most varied forms rose high into the air partly covered with driving clouds some were sharp but most were long and rounded here and there one saw bright shining glaciers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/760.mp3	plunging wildly down the steep sides and merging into the underlying ground in fearful confusion but the most remarkable of them all was mount helmer hanssen its top was as round as the bottom of a bowl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/761.mp3	and covered by an extraordinary ice sheet which was so broken up and disturbed that the blocks of ice bristled in every direction like the quills of a porcupine it glittered and burned in the sunlight a glorious spectacle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/762.mp3	the following letter served as a preface to the first edition of this memoir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/763.mp3	paris june thirtieth eighteen forty gentlemen in the course of your debate of the ninth of may eighteen thirty three in regard to the triennial pension established by madame suard

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/765.mp3	which has just expired i now propose gentlemen to discharge this duty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/766.mp3	when i solicited your votes i boldly avowed my intention to bend my efforts to the discovery of some means of ameliorating the physical
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/767.mp3	moral and intellectual condition of the mere numerous and poorer classes this idea foreign as it may have seemed to the object of my candidacy you received favorably
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/768.mp3	you changed this formal offer into an inviolable and sacred obligation thenceforth i understood with how worthy and honorable a society i had to deal my regard for its enlightenment my recognition of its benefits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/769.mp3	my enthusiasm for its glory were unbounded convinced at once that in order to break loose from the beaten paths of opinions and systems it was necessary to proceed in my study of man and society
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/770.mp3	by scientific methods and in a rigorous manner i devoted one year to philology and grammar linguistics or the natural history of speech being of all the sciences that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/771.mp3	seemed to bear the closest relation to the researches which i was about to commence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/772.mp3	if it did not reveal the astonishing success at least bore witness to the thoroughness of my labors since that time metaphysics and moral science have been my only studies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/773.mp3	my perception of the fact that these sciences though badly defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere are like the natural sciences susceptible of demonstration and certainty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/774.mp3	has already rewarded my efforts but gentlemen of all the masters whom i have followed to none do i owe so much as to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/775.mp3	your co operation your programmes your instructions in agreement with my secret wishes and most cherished hopes have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point out my road this memoir on property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/776.mp3	is the child of your thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/777.mp3	to what causes must we attribute the continually increasing number of suicides and what are the proper means for arresting the effects of this moral contagion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/778.mp3	thereby it asked in less general terms what was the cause of the social evil and what was its remedy you admitted that yourselves gentlemen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/779.mp3	when your committee reported that the competitors had enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular causes of suicide as well as the means of preventing each of them but that from this enumeration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/780.mp3	chronicled with more or less skill no positive information had been gained either as to the primary cause of the evil or as to its remedy in eighteen thirty nine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/781.mp3	your programme always original and varied in its academical expression became more exact the investigations of eighteen thirty eight had pointed out as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the social malady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/782.mp3	the neglect of the principles of religion and morality the desire for wealth the passion for enjoyment and political disturbances all these data were embodied by you in a single proposition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/783.mp3	the utility of the celebration of sunday as regards hygiene morality and social and political relation in a christian tongue you asked gentlemen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/784.mp3	what was the true system of society a competitor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/785.mp3	dared to maintain and believed that he had proved that the institution of a day of rest at weekly intervals is inseparably bound up with a political system based on the equality of conditions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/786.mp3	that without equality this institution is an anomaly and an impossibility that equality alone can revive this ancient and mysterious keeping of the seventh day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/787.mp3	this argument did not meet with your approbation since without denying the relation pointed out by the competitor you judged and rightly gentlemen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/788.mp3	that the principle of equality of conditions not being demonstrated the ideas of the author were nothing more than hypotheses finally gentlemen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/789.mp3	this fundamental principle of equality you presented for competition in the following terms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/790.mp3	the economical and moral consequences in france up to the present time and those which seem likely to appear in future of the law concerning the equal division of hereditary property between the children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/791.mp3	instead of confining one to common places without breadth or significance it seems to me that your question should be developed as follows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/792.mp3	can it not render it equal for all his grandchildren and great grandchildren if the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the family can it not by the right of heredity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/793.mp3	cease to heed it in the race in the tribe in the nation can equality by the right of succession be preserved between citizens as well as between cousins and brothers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/794.mp3	in a word can the principle of succession become a principle of equality to sum up all these ideas in one inclusive question what is the principle of heredity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/795.mp3	what are the foundations of inequality what is property such gentlemen is the object of the memoir that i offer you to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/796.mp3	if i have rightly grasped the object of your thought if i succeed in bringing to light a truth which is indisputable but from causes which i am bold enough to claim to have explained
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/797.mp3	has always been misunderstood if by an infallible method of investigation i establish the dogma of equality of conditions if i determine the principle of civil law the essence of justice and the form of society
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/798.mp3	to you gentlemen will redound all the glory for it is to your aid and your inspiration that i owe it my purpose in this work is the application of method
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/799.mp3	to the problems of philosophy every other intention is foreign to and even abusive of it i have spoken lightly of jurisprudence i had the right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/800.mp3	but i should be unjust did i not distinguish between this pretended science and the men who practise it devoted to studies both laborious and severe

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/802.mp3	and their unwarranted blunders have disgusted me whoever knowing them pardons them may read them i have severely blamed the learned christian church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/803.mp3	it was my duty this blame results from the facts which i call attention to why has the church decreed concerning things which it does not understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/804.mp3	the church has erred in dogma and in morals physics and mathematics testify against her it may be wrong for me to say it but surely it is unfortunate for christianity that it is true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/805.mp3	to restore religion gentlemen it is necessary to condemn the church perhaps you will regret gentlemen that in giving all my attention to method and evidence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/806.mp3	i have too much neglected form and style in vain should i have tried to do better literary hope and faith i have none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/807.mp3	that is the reason in my opinion why among so many men of talent france to day counts not one great writer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/808.mp3	in a society like ours to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism of what use is it to invoke an ancient sibyl when a muse is on the eve of birth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/809.mp3	pitiable actors in a tragedy nearing its end that which it behooves us to do is to precipitate the catastrophe the most deserving among us is he who plays best this part well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/810.mp3	i no longer aspire to this sad success why should i not confess it gentlemen i have aspired to your suffrages and sought the title of your pensioner hating all which exists and full of projects for its destruction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/811.mp3	and the most precious fruit that i could wish to gather from this memoir would be the inspiration of my readers with that tranquillity of soul which arises from the clear perception of evil and its cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/812.mp3	and which is much more powerful than passion and enthusiasm my hatred of privilege and human authority was unbounded perhaps at times i have been guilty in my indignation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/813.mp3	of confounding persons and things at present i can only despise and complain to cease to hate i only needed to know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/814.mp3	it is for you now gentlemen whose mission and character are the proclamation of the truth it is for you to instruct the people and to tell them for what they ought to hope
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/815.mp3	and what they ought to fear the people incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for them applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas provided that in them they get a taste of flattery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/816.mp3	to them the laws of thought are like the confines of the possible to day they can no more distinguish between a savant and a sophist than formerly they could tell a physician from a sorcerer

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/821.mp3	two months after the receipt of this letter the academy in its debate of august twenty fourth replied to the address of its pensioner by a note the text of which i give below
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/822.mp3	published last june by the titulary of the suard pension entitled what is property and dedicated by the author to the academy he is of the opinion that the society owes it to justice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/823.mp3	to example and to its own dignity to publicly disavow all responsibility for the anti social doctrines contained in this publication in consequence he demands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/824.mp3	in the most formal manner the work of the suard pensioner as having been published without its assent and as attributing to it opinions diametrically opposed to the principles of each of its members
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/825.mp3	in case he should publish a second edition of his book to omit the dedication
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/826.mp3	that this judgment of the academy be placed upon the records these three propositions put to vote are adopted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/827.mp3	after this ludicrous decree which its authors thought to render powerful by giving it the form of a contradiction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/828.mp3	i can only beg the reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our academy while my patrons in the social and political sciences were fulminating anathemas against my brochure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/829.mp3	who did not know me who might even have regarded himself as personally attacked by the too sharp judgment which i had passed upon the economists a publicist as learned as he was modest loved by the people whose sorrows he felt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/830.mp3	honored by the power which he sought to enlighten without flattering or disgracing it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/831.mp3	member of the institute professor of political economy defender of property took up my defence before his associates and before the ministry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/832.mp3	and saved me from the blows of a justice which is always blind because it is always ignorant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/833.mp3	a letter as honorable to its author as it is flattering to him to whom it is addressed paris may first eighteen forty one monsieur
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/834.mp3	i hasten to thank you for forwarding to me your second memoir upon property i have read it with all the interest that an acquaintance with the first would naturally inspire i am very glad that you have modified somewhat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/835.mp3	the rudeness of form which gave to a work of such gravity the manner and appearance of a pamphlet for you quite frightened me sir and your talent was needed to reassure me in regard to your intentions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/836.mp3	this proposition now coming into notice property is robbery was of a nature to repel from your book even those serious minds who do not judge by appearances had you persisted in maintaining it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/837.mp3	in its rude simplicity but if you have softened the form you are none the less faithful to the ground work of your doctrines and although you have done me the honor to give me a share in this perilous teaching
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/838.mp3	i cannot accept a partnership which as far as talent goes would surely be a credit to me but which would compromise me in all other respects i agree with you in one thing only
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/839.mp3	namely that all kinds of property get too frequently abused in this world but i do not reason from the abuse to the abolition an heroic remedy too much like death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/840.mp3	which cures all evils i will go farther i will confess that of all abuses the most hateful to me are those of property but once more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/841.mp3	there is a remedy for this evil without violating it all the more without destroying it if the present laws allow abuse we can reconstruct them our civil code is not the koran
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/842.mp3	it is not wrong to examine it change then the laws which govern the use of property but be sparing of anathemas for logically where is the honest man whose hands are entirely clean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/843.mp3	do you think that one can be a robber without knowing it without wishing it without suspecting it do you not admit that society in its present state like every man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/844.mp3	has in its constitution all kinds of virtues and vices inherited from our ancestors is property then in your eyes a thing so simple and so abstract that you can re knead and equalize it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/845.mp3	if i may so speak in your metaphysical mill one who has said as many excellent and practical things as occur in these two beautiful and paradoxical improvisations of yours cannot be a pure and unwavering utopist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/846.mp3	you are too well acquainted with the economical and academical phraseology to play with the hard words of revolutions i believe then that you have handled property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/847.mp3	as rousseau eighty years ago handled letters with a magnificent and poetical display of wit and knowledge such at least is my opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/848.mp3	that is what i said to the institute at the time when i presented my report upon your book i knew that they wished to proceed against you in the courts you perhaps do not know by how narrow a chance i succeeded in preventing them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/849.mp3	what chagrin i should always have felt if the king's counsel that is to say the intellectual executioner had followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/850.mp3	i actually passed two terrible nights and i succeeded in restraining the secular arm only by showing that your book was an academical dissertation and not the manifesto of an incendiary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/851.mp3	your style is too lofty ever to be of service to the madmen who in discussing the gravest questions of our social order use paving stones as their weapons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/852.mp3	but see to it sir that ere long they do not come in spite of you to seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal and that your vigorous metaphysics falls not into the hands of some sophist of the market place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/853.mp3	who might discuss the question in the presence of a starving audience we should have pillage for conclusion and peroration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/854.mp3	but the majestic and imposing order of human societies that i sometimes find myself embarrassed in attacking certain abuses i like to rebuild with one hand when i am compelled to destroy with the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/855.mp3	in pruning an old tree we guard against destruction of the buds and fruit you know that as well as any one you are a wise and learned man you have a thoughtful mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/856.mp3	the terms by which you characterize the fanatics of our day are strong enough to reassure the most suspicious imaginations as to your intentions but you conclude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/857.mp3	in favor of the abolition of property you wish to abolish the most powerful motor of the human mind you attack the paternal sentiment in its sweetest illusions with one word you arrest the formation of capital
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/858.mp3	and we build henceforth upon the sand instead of on a rock that i cannot agree to and for that reason i have criticised your book so full of beautiful pages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/859.mp3	so brilliant with knowledge and fervor i wish sir that my impaired health would permit me to examine with you page by page the memoir which you have done me the honor to address to me publicly and personally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/860.mp3	i desire also the merit of prudence you know how deep seated is the disease under which the working people are suffering i know how many noble hearts beat under those rude garments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/861.mp3	who rise early in the morning to labor to pay their taxes and to make our country strong i try to serve and enlighten them whereas some endeavor to mislead them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/862.mp3	you have not written directly for them you have issued two magnificent manifestoes the second more guarded than the first issue a third more guarded than the second
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/863.mp3	and you will take high rank in science whose first precept is calmness and impartiality farewell sir no man's esteem for another can exceed mine for you blanqui
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/864.mp3	i should certainly take some exceptions to this noble and eloquent letter but i confess that i am more inclined to realize the prediction with which it terminates than to augment needlessly the number of my antagonists
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/865.mp3	so much controversy fatigues and wearies me the intelligence expended in the warfare of words is like that employed in battle it is intelligence wasted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/866.mp3	i call property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/867.mp3	to each of us property seems a polygon whose angles need knocking off but the operation performed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/868.mp3	an hypothesis admitted in mathematics although not proven while i consider that this figure will be a circle honest people can at least understand one another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/869.mp3	for the rest i allow that in the present state of the question the mind may legitimately hesitate before deciding in favor of the abolition of property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/870.mp3	to gain the victory for one's cause it does not suffice simply to overthrow a principle generally recognized which has the indisputable merit of systematically recapitulating our political theories
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/871.mp3	it is also necessary to establish the opposite principle and to formulate the system which must proceed from it still further it is necessary to show the method by which the new system
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/872.mp3	will satisfy all the moral and political needs which induced the establishment of the first on the following conditions then of subsequent evidence depends the correctness of my preceding arguments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/873.mp3	the discovery of a system of absolute equality in which all existing institutions save property or the sum of the abuses of property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/874.mp3	not only may find a place but may themselves serve as instruments of equality individual liberty the division of power the public ministry the jury system
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/875.mp3	administrative and judicial organization the unity and completeness of instruction marriage the family heredity in direct and collateral succession the right of sale and exchange the right to make a will and even birthright
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/876.mp3	a system which better than property guarantees the formation of capital and keeps up the courage of all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/877.mp3	the road that he shall traverse will suffice to show the end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/878.mp3	chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/879.mp3	that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynde's hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/880.mp3	for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/881.mp3	and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/882.mp3	but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/883.mp3	helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/884.mp3	as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/885.mp3	anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/886.mp3	the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lynde's husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/887.mp3	missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/888.mp3	peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/889.mp3	and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/890.mp3	had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/891.mp3	he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often missus rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/892.mp3	and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/893.mp3	if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/894.mp3	yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzled that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/895.mp3	the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/896.mp3	had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/897.mp3	barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/898.mp3	bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd ruther look at people to be sure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/899.mp3	they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/900.mp3	set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/901.mp3	one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/902.mp3	or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/903.mp3	whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/904.mp3	and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/905.mp3	there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/906.mp3	yet what of matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/907.mp3	how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/908.mp3	thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/909.mp3	but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor we're all pretty well said missus rachel i was kind of afraid you weren't though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctor's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/910.mp3	marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/911.mp3	matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/912.mp3	she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/913.mp3	said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation missus rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/914.mp3	marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/915.mp3	what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/916.mp3	missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/917.mp3	so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/918.mp3	there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/919.mp3	they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/920.mp3	so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/921.mp3	old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/922.mp3	so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself missus rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/923.mp3	well marilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/924.mp3	nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/925.mp3	and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/926.mp3	this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/927.mp3	it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/928.mp3	and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/929.mp3	only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said marilla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/930.mp3	as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/931.mp3	missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/932.mp3	and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/933.mp3	it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/934.mp3	it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/935.mp3	my but i pity him that's what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/936.mp3	chapter two matthew cuthbert is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/937.mp3	or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/938.mp3	matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/939.mp3	he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/940.mp3	and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/941.mp3	he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/942.mp3	matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/943.mp3	and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/944.mp3	the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/945.mp3	she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/946.mp3	guess there's some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/947.mp3	i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/948.mp3	maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/949.mp3	and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/950.mp3	a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/951.mp3	her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/952.mp3	might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/953.mp3	was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/954.mp3	i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/955.mp3	i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/956.mp3	i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/957.mp3	matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/958.mp3	no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables i'm sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/959.mp3	it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i'd better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/960.mp3	we've got to drive a long piece haven't we missus spencer said it was eight miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it four months but that was enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/961.mp3	it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/962.mp3	they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/963.mp3	who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/964.mp3	i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthew's companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/965.mp3	the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/966.mp3	isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/967.mp3	i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/968.mp3	but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/969.mp3	i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldn't sell it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/970.mp3	but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/971.mp3	and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/972.mp3	she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/973.mp3	oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/974.mp3	and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/975.mp3	and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dunno said matthew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/976.mp3	there'd be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talk if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/977.mp3	was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/978.mp3	he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/979.mp3	and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/988.mp3	we will fight for him yes we will die for him and a large part of the common soldier's patriotism was this heart response of the boys to the great boy in the white house

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/996.mp3	and the country any good but it hurt him deep in his heart to know that some of his beloved children misunderstood him so that they were willing to kill him it was no one's bullet which made abraham lincoln a martyr

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1096.mp3	not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1097.mp3	unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugenie had not taken place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1098.mp3	not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1099.mp3	had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1102.mp3	still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugenie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart tea play
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1103.mp3	and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1104.mp3	awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1107.mp3	and believed firmly in her daughter's innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at eugenie's door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1108.mp3	and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle eugenie said the maid

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1116.mp3	supported by an honorable name how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1118.mp3	but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1119.mp3	it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1120.mp3	no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea's intrigues
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1121.mp3	appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1139.mp3	preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1140.mp3	raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips forgive my servants he said for a terror i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1146.mp3	said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him well then be more affectionate my dear villefort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1147.mp3	said the baroness speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed when i hear misfortunes named madame
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1148.mp3	he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1149.mp3	but this annoys you let us change the subject you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1154.mp3	impossible madame justice has its formalities what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest for all even for myself among the rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1155.mp3	replied villefort ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1156.mp3	you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1157.mp3	have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly yes you were thinking of it and with justice

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1159.mp3	the baroness became pale you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1160.mp3	then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1161.mp3	villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1162.mp3	now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say listen

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1164.mp3	and who is this wretch who can tell a vagabond a corsican has no one owned him no one his parents are unknown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1165.mp3	but who was the man who brought him from lucca another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice the baroness clasped her hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1166.mp3	for heaven's sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven's sake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1167.mp3	what am i the law has the law any eyes to witness your grief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1168.mp3	has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall no madame

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1172.mp3	well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1173.mp3	i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses i have always found them and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1174.mp3	every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1175.mp3	with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1176.mp3	this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1177.mp3	but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1178.mp3	oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven at least

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1180.mp3	no madame said villefort instructions have been given
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1181.mp3	five days are more than i require
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1182.mp3	i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1183.mp3	i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1184.mp3	a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1185.mp3	madame danglars trembled with fear villefort started with joy arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiegne and all is over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1186.mp3	pale and cold adieu sir she said adieu madame replied the king's attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1187.mp3	everything was made ready for the wedding the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february it was then december a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1188.mp3	the grandfather was not the least happy of them all he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette the wonderful beautiful girl he exclaimed and she has so sweet and good an air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1189.mp3	she is without exception the most charming girl that i have ever seen in my life later on she'll have virtues with an odor of violets how graceful one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such a creature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1190.mp3	marius my boy you are a baron you are rich don't go to pettifogging i beg of you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1191.mp3	the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it do you understand anything about it said marius to cosette no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1192.mp3	jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1193.mp3	and apparently with as much joy as cosette herself as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate problem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1194.mp3	a sure means of not encountering any objections cosette was the only scion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other fauchelevent two brothers fauchelevent had been gardeners to the convent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1195.mp3	picpus inquiry was made at that convent the very best information and the most respectable references abounded the good nuns not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1196.mp3	of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the daughter they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal an acte de notoriete was drawn up cosette became in the eyes of the law mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1197.mp3	she was declared an orphan both father and mother being dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1198.mp3	that he was appointed under the name of fauchelevent as cosette's guardian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1199.mp3	as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to remain unknown the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety four thousand francs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1200.mp3	but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle euphrasie five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent this legacy deposited in the hands of a third party
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1201.mp3	was to be turned over to cosette at her majority or at the date of her marriage this taken as a whole was very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million there were some peculiarities here and there it is true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1202.mp3	that the cloud did not last long she had marius the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life and then cosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas around her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1203.mp3	a mysterious childhood is always prepared for certain renunciations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1204.mp3	it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and presents while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1205.mp3	nothing so amused him as being magnificent he had given to cosette

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1208.mp3	her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1209.mp3	with wings of mechlin lace the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already said by the ecstasy of the grandfather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1210.mp3	every morning a fresh offering of bric a brac from the grandfather to cosette all possible knickknacks glittered around her one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss said

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1262.mp3	but one rule is common to all of them never use psychotherapeutic methods in a schematic way like a rigid pattern schematic treatment is a poor treatment in every department of medicine but in psychotherapeutics it is disastrous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1263.mp3	there are no two cases alike and not only the easily recognizable differences of sex and age and occupation and education and financial means and temperament and capacity are decisive

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1267.mp3	most of the adjustment of method must be left to the instinct of the physician in which wide experience solid knowledge tact and sympathy ought to be blended even the way in which the patient reacts on the method will often guide the instinct of the well trained psychotherapist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1268.mp3	it is therefore certainly not enough that the knowledge of the physician simply decide beforehand on a definite course of psychical treatment and leave the carrying out to a well meaning minister or any other medical amateur who schematically follows the indicated path
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1269.mp3	the finest adjustment has to come in during the treatment itself and the response of the patient often has to suggest entirely new lines of procedure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1270.mp3	more than in any other field of medicine the physician himself has to extend his influence far beyond the office hours and the strictly medical relations and yet on the other hand there is no department of medicine in which the treatment might not profit by the psychotherapeutic influence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1271.mp3	subtle adjustment to the personal needs and to the individual conditions is necessary in every case where the psychical factor is to play an important role
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1272.mp3	it cannot be denied that the one great obstacle in the work of the routine physician is the lack of time and patience which is needed for successful treatment to prescribe drugs is always quicker than to influence the mind

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1275.mp3	if we take it in the widest meaning this would evidently include every possible medical task from filling a painful tooth to operating on a painful appendix as in every case where pain results the mental equilibrium is disturbed by it and the normal mental life of the patient reduced in its efficiency

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1278.mp3	especially in the digestive and sexual spheres are sources of irritation which slowly influence the whole personality
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1279.mp3	to be sure the brain disturbance may have reached a point where the mere removal of the original affliction is not sufficient to reinstate the normal balance of mental energies but wherever such a bodily irritation goes on it is never too late to abolish it in the interests of psychotherapy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1280.mp3	however often he may get the impression that such a liberation would stop the source of the mental trouble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1281.mp3	often within a surprisingly short time the brain gathers the energies to overcome the frictions with unavoidable surroundings yet here the physician has to adjust the prescribed dose of outing very carefully to the special case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1282.mp3	we may be guided by the psychological experiments which have been made in the interest of testing the fatigue induced by mental work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1283.mp3	if perhaps four hours of concentrated work are done without pauses experiment shows that the quality of the work deteriorates measured for instance by the number of mistakes in quick calculation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1284.mp3	the instinct of the physician has to find the middle way between a temporary removal of irritation which really allows a development of new energies and a mere interruption which simply damages the acquired relative adjustment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1285.mp3	every cause of friction which can be permanently annihilated for the patient certainly should be removed this negative remedy demands its positive supplement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1286.mp3	the patient must be brought under conditions and influences which give fair chances for the recuperation of his energies too often from the standpoint of the psychologist the prescription is simply rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1287.mp3	as far as rest involves sleep it is certainly the ideal prescription there is no other influence which builds up the injured central nervous system as safely as sound natural sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1288.mp3	and loss of sleep is certainly one of the most pernicious conditions for the brain again rest is a great factor in those systematic rest cures which for a long while were almost the fashion with the neurologist

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1292.mp3	that is a story which we hear a thousand times nowadays yet it is doubtful whether there is really much truth in such a claim and whether much wise psychotherapy can be deduced from it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1293.mp3	we may begin even with the very justifiable doubt whether nervousness really has increased in our time earlier periods had not so many names for those symptoms and were not able to discriminate them with the same clearness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1294.mp3	even today most people are still without suspicion that a neurasthenic or a psychasthenic or a hysteric disturbance of the nervous system may be in its beginning

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1299.mp3	moreover our life has probably become cooler there is less emotionalism less sentimentality more business like attitude and that all means less inner friction and excitement in public life too less fear of war and less religious struggle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1300.mp3	above all the intensity of mental stimuli is always relative the psychologist knows the experiments which determine that we perceive the difference of impressions as alike when the stimuli are proportional

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1306.mp3	they should not be complete rest or complete change of life for any length of time but a continuation of the life for which adjustment has been learned with a reasonable reduction of the demands and stimulations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1307.mp3	the intellectual worker ought to decrease his work the overbusy society woman ought to stay in bed one day in the week the man in the midst of the rush of life ought to cut down his obligations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1308.mp3	but probably each of them does better to go on than simply to swear off altogether their rest ought to have the character of vacation that means interruptions without the usual activity ought to be short periods spent with the distinct feeling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1309.mp3	that they are interruptions of that which must last and that they are not themselves to become lasting states
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1310.mp3	strenuosity must not mean an external rush with the gestures of overbusy excitement but certainly the doctrine of the lazy life is wretched psychotherapy as long as no serious illness is in question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1311.mp3	by far the best alteration is therefore even in the periods of interruption not simply rest but new engagements which awaken new interests and stimulate neglected mental factors disburdening the over strained elements of mental life

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1315.mp3	while the advice of the physician ought thus to emphasize the positive elements which work not towards rest but toward a harmonious mental activity we must not forget some essential negative prescriptions

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1322.mp3	the silent attention of her hearers permitted her to be generally understood she called attention to the fact that this campaign was important because it promised more beautiful and attractive houses for the farmers and townsmen alike
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1323.mp3	we had all grown so accustomed to advertising signs she said that we failed to notice how thick they were becoming or how bold and overpowering from a few scattered announcements on fence boards
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1324.mp3	they had crowded themselves into more prominent places until the barns and sheds and the very rocks were daubed with glaring letters asking us to buy the medicines soaps tobaccos and other wares the manufacturers were anxious to sell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1325.mp3	every country road became an advertising avenue scarcely a country house was free from signs of some sort yet the people tamely submitted to this imposition because they knew no way to avoid it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1326.mp3	when mister forbes began his campaign to restore the homesteads to their former beauty and dignity a cry was raised against him but this was because the farmers did not understand how much this reform meant to them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1327.mp3	so we gave them an object lesson we painted out all the signs in this section at our own expense that you might see how much more beautiful your homes are without them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1328.mp3	we believe that none of you will ever care to allow advertising signs on your property again and that the quiet refinement of this part of the country will induce many other places to follow our example

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1331.mp3	if he honestly desired to do so that was what a representative was for to represent his people it was folly to elect any man who would forget that duty and promote only his own interests through the position of power to which the people had appointed him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1332.mp3	mister forbes admitted that he had undertaken this campaign because he was opposed to offensive advertising signs but now he had become interested in other issues and was anxious to be elected so that he could carry on the work of reform

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1334.mp3	standing shielded behind the half closed blind of an upper window and listening to as well as watching the proceedings below then she remembered how the girl had been laughing and talking with mister hopkins when she first saw her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1335.mp3	her first impulse was to denounce the maid at once and have her discharged but the time was not opportune so she waited until the festivities were ended

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1338.mp3	when the last guest had departed beth got her cousins and kenneth together and told them of her discovery of the spy kenneth was at first greatly annoyed and proposed to call martha and have the false maid ejected from the premises
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1339.mp3	but patsy's wise little head counselled caution in handling the matter now that we know her secret she said the girl cannot cause us more real harm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1340.mp3	and there may be a way to circumvent this unscrupulous hopkins and turn the incident to our own advantage let's think it over carefully before we act there's another thing said beth supporting her cousin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1341.mp3	i'm interested in the mystery surrounding the girl i now think i was wrong in suspecting her to be the lost lucy rogers but there is surely some romance connected with her and she is not what she seems to be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1342.mp3	i'd like to study her a little it was absurd to connect her with lucy rogers observed kenneth for there is nothing in her character to remind one of the unhappy girl except her looks added beth she's the living image of missus rogers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1343.mp3	that isn't important replied louise it is probably a mere coincidence none of us have ever seen the real lucy and she may not resemble her mother at all missus rogers claims she does said beth but anyhow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1344.mp3	i have a wish to keep this girl at the house where i can study her character then keep her my dear decided kenneth i'll set a couple of men to watch the gates and if she goes out we'll know whom she meets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1345.mp3	the most she can do is to report our movements to mister hopkins and there's no great harm in that so the matter was left for the time and as if to verify beth's suspicions eliza was seen to leave the grounds after dusk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1346.mp3	and meet mister hopkins in the lane they conversed together a few moments and then the maid calmly returned and went to her room the next day mister hopkins scattered flaring hand bills over the district
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1347.mp3	they read hopkins the man of the times is the champion of the signs of the times forbes who never earned a dollar in his life but inherited his money is trying to take the dollars out of the pockets of the farmers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1348.mp3	by depriving them of the income derived by selling spaces for advertising signs he is robbing the farmers while claiming he wants to beautify their homes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1349.mp3	therefore they are going to vote for the honorable erastus hopkins for representative then followed an estimate of the money paid the farmers of the district by the advertisers during the past five years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1350.mp3	amounting to several thousands of dollars in the aggregate the circular ended in this way hopkins challenges forbes to deny these facts hopkins is willing to meet forbes before the public at any time and place he may select
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1351.mp3	to settle this argument in joint debate the girls accepted the challenge at once within two days every farmer had received a notice that mister forbes would meet mister hopkins

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1353.mp3	because of the activity of the opposing candidates every voter in the district had become more or less interested in the fight and people were taking one side or the other with unusual earnestness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1354.mp3	mister hopkins was not greatly pleased that his challenge had been accepted he had imagined that the forbes party would ignore it and leave him the prestige of crowing over his opponent's timidity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1355.mp3	but he remembered how easily he had subdued kenneth at the school house meeting before the nominations and had no doubt of his ability to repeat the operation he was much incensed against the girls who were working for kenneth forbes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1356.mp3	for he realized that they were proving an important factor in the campaign he even attributed to them more than they deserved for uncle john's telling activities were so quietly conducted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1357.mp3	that he was personally lost sight of entirely by mister hopkins mister hopkins had therefore become so enraged that against the advice of his friends he issued a circular sneering at women in politics
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1358.mp3	the newspapers having been subsidized by the opposition so early in the game mister hopkins had driven to employ the circular method of communicating with the voters scarcely a day passed now that his corps of distributors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1359.mp3	did not leave some of his literature at every dwelling in the district his tirade against the girls was neither convincing nor in good taste he asked the voters if they were willing to submit to petticoat government and permit a
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1360.mp3	lot of boarding school girls with more boldness than modesty to dictate the policies of the community these frizzle headed females continued the circular are trying to make your wives and daughters as rebellious and unreasonable as they are themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1361.mp3	but no man of sense will permit a woman to influence his vote it is a disgrace to this district that mister forbes allows his girlish campaign to be run by a lot of misses who should be at home darning stockings or if they were not able to do that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1362.mp3	if i'm not much mistaken mister hopkins has thrown a boomerang every woman who attended the fete is now linked with us as an ally and every one of them will resent this foolish circular
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1363.mp3	i'm sorry said kenneth that you girls should be forced to endure this i feared something like it when you insisted on taking a hand in the game but they laughed at him

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1377.mp3	in spirit and only southerners i planned that when they were both old enough they should marry in the south and live there and my husband and i with them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1378.mp3	but in this life things seldom turn out as we plan my little girl died before she was three and i had scarcely become reconciled to this grief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1379.mp3	when my husband was also taken from me so i centered all my hopes on my son on fairfax as he grew older however and as the civil war came nearer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1380.mp3	i noticed that he talked more and more in sympathy with the north and this distressed me terribly however i thought it best not to say much about it to him for he was a headstrong boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1381.mp3	and had always resented opposition and i felt sure that he would see things differently when he was older i wished to send him to a southern college but he begged me to send him to harvard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1382.mp3	as his heart was so set on it i couldn't deny him thinking that even this would make little difference in the end then came the crisis in the country's affairs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1383.mp3	and the confederacy was declared i had already begun to correspond with southern authorities to arrange about raising a company for fairfax i never doubted that he would comply with my wishes but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1384.mp3	i little knew him i hardly need to tell you of the awful day that he came home you are already acquainted with the history of it that afternoon shortly after he arrived
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1385.mp3	we had our interview i have always possessed the most violent temper a mortal had to struggle with and in those earlier years when i got into a rage it blinded me to everything else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1386.mp3	to every other earthly consideration and during that interview well need i say it fairfax was simply immovable gentle and loving always
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1387.mp3	but i could no more impress him with my wishes than i could have moved the rock of gibraltar the galling part to me was that he kept insisting he was only doing what was right right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1388.mp3	how could he be right when it was all directly contrary but never mind that now i have learned differently with the passing sorrowful years but to go back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1389.mp3	i stood it as long as i could and then i turned from him disowned him bade him leave the house at once and never see my face again and informed him that i myself would abandon the place on the morrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1390.mp3	and return to the south he left me without another word and went to his room i immediately summoned the servants and dismissed them on the spot giving them only time to get their things together and go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1391.mp3	then i locked myself in my room till he was gone he came several times knocked at my door and begged me to see him but i would not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1392.mp3	heaven forgive me i would not so he must have left me that note she covered her eyes with her hand a moment then she went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1393.mp3	i never saw or knew of it till this day if i had just at this point they were all startled by a loud knock coming from the direction of the front door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1394.mp3	so unexpected was the sound that they could only stare at each other inquiringly without stirring in a moment it came again a thumping of the old knocker on the front inner door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1395.mp3	i guess i'd better go said joyce some one may have seen the little boarded up door open did you leave it open she asked turning to missus collingwood i think i did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1396.mp3	i was too hurried and nervous when i came in to think of it that's it then some one has seen it open and has stopped to inquire if everything is all right she hurried away to the front door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1397.mp3	and after an effort succeeded in pulling it open a man a complete stranger to her stood outside they regarded each other with mutual surprise pardon me he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1398.mp3	but perhaps you can inform me is any one living in this house at present why no replied joyce rather confusedly that is no the house is empty except just just to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1399.mp3	oh er i see the fact is the stranger went on i was passing here and noticed this outer door open which seemed a little queer i used to know the people who lived here very well indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1400.mp3	and i have been wondering whether the house was still in their possession it seemed to be untenanted at his mention of knowing the family joyce looked him over with considerably more interest he was tall straight and robust
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1401.mp3	though rather verging on the elderly his iron gray hair was crisply curly and his dark eyes twinkled out from under bushy gray brows his smile was captivating
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1402.mp3	joyce decided at once that she liked him oh did you know the family the the collingwoods he supplemented with his twinkling smile yes i knew them quite intimately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1403.mp3	might i perhaps if it would not be intruding come in just a moment to look once more at the old place that is he added hastily seeing her hesitate only if it would be entirely convenient
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1404.mp3	i do not know of course why the house is open perhaps people are are about to purchase it joyce was for a moment tongue tied with perplexity she hated to refuse the simple wish of this pleasant stranger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1405.mp3	yet how was she to comply with it considering the presence of missus collingwood and the almost unexplainable position of herself and cynthia what would he think of it all while she was hesitating an idea came to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1406.mp3	there is one of the family here to day on on business she said at last if you will give me your name i will ask if that person would like to see you oh that is hardly worth while
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1407.mp3	my name is calthorpe but i'm sure they wouldn't remember me after all this time and i do not wish to trouble them but joyce had excused herself and turned away as soon as she heard the name leaving him standing there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1408.mp3	missus collingwood however shook her head when joyce announced who was outside i do not remember any one named calthorpe and i scarcely feel that i can see a stranger now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1409.mp3	but we must not be inhospitable miss cynthia and i will go and sit in the library and you can bring him into the drawing room a few moments there is no other part of the house that can very well be shown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1410.mp3	she took cynthia's arm walked into the library and partly closed the door while joyce went out to admit the stranger if you care to look around the drawing room you will be most welcome she announced politely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1411.mp3	he accepted the invitation gratefully and entered with her at the first glance however he started back slightly as with a shock of surprise why how strange how very singular he murmured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1412.mp3	these candles everything everything just the same as though it were yesterday did you often come here inquired joyce you must be very well acquainted with the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1413.mp3	yes i came often i was almost like an inmate he began to wander slowly about the room examining the pictures in front of the baby twins he paused a long time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1414.mp3	then you must have known young mister fairfax very well suggested joyce that's he on the right in the picture the stranger eyed her curiously why yes i knew him well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1415.mp3	but you little lady seem quite intimate with the collingwood family history tell me are you a a relative this confused joyce anew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1416.mp3	but i have been told a good deal about them an unhappy family was his only comment and he continued his tour around the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1417.mp3	in front of the old square open piano he paused again and fingered the silk scarf that had at some long ago date been thrown carelessly upon it then he ran his fingers lightly over the yellow keys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1418.mp3	the tones were unbelievably jangling and discordant yet joyce thought she caught the notes of a little tune and in another moment he broke into the air singing softly the opening line
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1419.mp3	he had sung no more when the face of missus collingwood appeared in the doorway her eyes were wide and staring her features almost gray in color
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1420.mp3	who who are you she demanded in a voice scarcely louder than a whisper the stranger gazed at her with a fixed look arthur
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1421.mp3	arthur calthorpe he faltered no you are not they drew toward each other unconsciously as though moving in a dream no one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1422.mp3	missus collingwood came closer and uttered a sudden low cry my son mother the two girls who had been watching this scene with amazement unutterable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1423.mp3	then with a beautiful gesture the man held out his arms and the woman with a little gasp of happiness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1424.mp3	but as sure as he found a princess he found some fault in her of course he could not marry a mere woman however beautiful and there was no princess to be found worthy of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1425.mp3	whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself i cannot pretend to say all i know is that he was a fine handsome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1426.mp3	brave generous well bred and well behaved youth as all princes are in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1427.mp3	he never dreamed that she could bewitch him for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity who could tell what she might not lose next she might lose her visibility or her tangibility
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1428.mp3	or in short the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive of course he made no further inquiries about her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1429.mp3	one day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest these forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers like a sieve that keeps back the bran then the princes get away to follow their fortunes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1430.mp3	in this way they have the advantage of the princesses who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun i wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes one lovely evening after wandering about for many days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1431.mp3	he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them and he soon came upon a kind of heath next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1432.mp3	at length he entered another wood not a wild forest but a civilized wood through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1433.mp3	suddenly he paused and listened strange sounds came across the water it was in fact the princess laughing now there was something odd in her laugh as i have already hinted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1434.mp3	for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming looking over the lake he saw something white in the water and in an instant he had torn off his tunic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1435.mp3	now i cannot tell how it came about whether she pretended to be drowning or whether he frightened her or caught her so as to embarrass her but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1436.mp3	and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak at the place to which he bore her the bank was only a foot or two above the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1437.mp3	so he gave her a strong lift out of the water to lay her on the bank but her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water away she went up into the air scolding and screaming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1438.mp3	you naughty naughty naughty naughty man she cried no one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before when the prince saw her ascend he thought he must have been bewitched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1439.mp3	the prince meantime stood in the water staring and forgetting to get out but the princess disappearing he scrambled on shore and went in the direction of the tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1440.mp3	until reaching the ground and seeing him standing there she caught hold of him and said i'll tell papa oh no you won't returned the prince yes i will she persisted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1441.mp3	what business had you to pull me down out of the water and throw me to the bottom of the air i never did you any harm pardon me i did not mean to hurt you i don't believe you have any brains and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1442.mp3	i pity you the prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess and had already offended her but before he could think what to say next she burst out angrily giving a stamp with her foot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1443.mp3	that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm put me up directly put you up where you beauty asked the prince he had fallen in love with her almost already
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1444.mp3	for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her and as far as he could see which certainly was not far she had not a single fault about her except of course that she had not any gravity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1445.mp3	no prince however would judge of a princess by weight the loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud put you up where you beauty asked the prince in the water you stupid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1446.mp3	answered the princess come then said the prince the condition of her dress increasing her usual difficulty in walking compelled her to cling to him and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1447.mp3	he turned towards the princess and said how am i to put you in that is your business she answered quite snappishly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1448.mp3	very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1449.mp3	it seemed to me like going up rejoined she my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1450.mp3	said the princess beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw no more of that i am tired of it said the princess perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1451.mp3	don't you like falling in then said the prince it is the most delightful fun i ever had in my life answered she i never fell before i wish i could learn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1452.mp3	to think i am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall here the poor princess looked almost sad i shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like said the prince devotedly thank you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1453.mp3	i don't know perhaps it would not be proper but i don't care at all events as we have fallen in let us have a swim together with all my heart responded the prince
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1454.mp3	and away they went swimming and diving and floating until at last they heard cries along the shore and saw lights glancing in all directions it was now quite late and there was no moon i must go home said the princess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1455.mp3	at least i don't exactly know where it is i wish i hadn't one either rejoined the princess it is so stupid i have a great mind she continued to play them all a trick why couldn't they leave me alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1456.mp3	they won't trust me in the lake for a single night you see where that green light is burning that is the window of my room now if you would just swim there with me very quietly and when we are all but under the balcony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1457.mp3	as you did a little while ago i should be able to catch hold of the balcony and get in at the window and then they may look for me till to morrow morning with more obedience than pleasure said the prince gallantly and away they swam very gently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1458.mp3	will you be in the lake to morrow night the prince ventured to ask to be sure i will i don't think so perhaps was the princess's somewhat strange answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1459.mp3	and merely whispered as he gave her the parting lift don't tell the only answer the princess returned was a roguish look she was already a yard above his head the look seemed to say never fear it is too good fun to spoil that way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1460.mp3	so perfectly like other people had she been in the water that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly grasp the balcony and disappear through the window
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1461.mp3	he turned almost expecting to see her still by his side but he was alone in the water so he swam away quietly and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1462.mp3	as soon as they disappeared he landed in search of his tunic and sword and after some trouble found them again then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side there the wood was wilder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1463.mp3	and the shore steeper rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night and all night long he soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1464.mp3	and where even in the broad daylight he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore it was a sort of cave in the rock where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1465.mp3	but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1466.mp3	cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley after which they thought to send him back to the general father of the order at rome by the first ship this advice was well received the old woman approved it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1467.mp3	they said not a word to his sister the thing was executed for a little money and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a jesuit and punishing the pride of a german baron
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1468.mp3	it is natural to imagine that after so many disasters candide married and living with the philosopher pangloss the philosopher martin the prudent cacambo and the old woman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1469.mp3	having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas must have led a very happy life but he was so much imposed upon by the jews that he had nothing left except his small farm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1470.mp3	his wife became uglier every day more peevish and unsupportable the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde cacambo who worked in the garden and took vegetables for sale to constantinople
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1471.mp3	and they saw other cadis pashas and effendis coming to supply the place of the exiles and afterwards exiled in their turn they saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the sublime porte
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1472.mp3	i want to know which is worse to be ravished a hundred times by negro pirates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1473.mp3	in short to go through all the miseries we have undergone or to stay here and have nothing to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1474.mp3	this discourse gave rise to new reflections and martin especially concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting inquietude or of lethargic disgust
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1475.mp3	pangloss owned that he had always suffered horribly but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well he asserted it still though he no longer believed it what helped to confirm martin in his detestable principles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1476.mp3	they had soon squandered their three thousand piastres parted were reconciled quarrelled again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1477.mp3	that your presents would soon be dissipated and only make them the more miserable you have rolled in millions of money you and cacambo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1478.mp3	ha said pangloss to paquette providence has then brought you amongst us again my poor child do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose an eye and an ear as you may see what a world is this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1479.mp3	and now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever in the neighbourhood there lived a very famous dervish who was esteemed the best philosopher in all turkey and they went to consult him pangloss was the speaker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1480.mp3	master said he we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal as man was made with what meddlest thou said the dervish is it thy business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1481.mp3	there is horrible evil in this world what signifies it said the dervish whether there be evil or good when his highness sends a ship to egypt does he trouble his head whether the mice on board are at their ease or not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1482.mp3	what then must we do said pangloss hold your tongue answered the dervish i was in hopes said pangloss that i should reason with you a little about causes and effects about the best of possible worlds the origin of evil the nature of the soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1483.mp3	and the pre established harmony at these words the dervish shut the door in their faces during this conversation the news was spread that two viziers and the mufti had been strangled at constantinople and that several of their friends had been impaled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1484.mp3	asked the old man what was the name of the strangled mufti i do not know answered the worthy man and i have not known the name of any mufti nor of any vizier i am entirely ignorant of the event you mention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1485.mp3	i presume in general that they who meddle with the administration of public affairs die sometimes miserably and that they deserve it but i never trouble my head about what is transacting at constantinople
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1486.mp3	i content myself with sending there for sale the fruits of the garden which i cultivate having said these words he invited the strangers into his house his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet which they made themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1487.mp3	with kaimak enriched with the candied peel of citrons with oranges lemons pine apples pistachio nuts and mocha coffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of batavia or the american islands

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1501.mp3	this is very kind of you the prince went to dress for the occasion for he was resolved to die like a prince when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1502.mp3	she was so transported that she jumped off the bed feeble as she was and danced about the room for joy she did not care who the man was that was nothing to her the hole wanted stopping and if only a man would do why take one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1503.mp3	where they had already placed a little boat for her the water was not deep enough to float it but they hoped it would be before long they laid her on cushions placed in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things and stretched a canopy over all

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1507.mp3	the prince looked at the hole and saw but one way he put both his legs into it sitting on the stone and stooping forward covered the corner that remained open with his two hands in this uncomfortable position
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1508.mp3	he resolved to abide his fate and turning to the people said now you can go the king had already gone home to dinner now you can go repeated the princess after him like a parrot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1509.mp3	the people obeyed her and went presently a little wave flowed over the stone and wetted one of the prince's knees but he did not mind it much

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1511.mp3	thought the prince but you are worth dying for after all again a wavelet and another and another flowed over the stone and wetted both the prince's knees but he did not speak or move

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1513.mp3	at last he could bear it no longer princess said he but at the moment up started the princess crying i'm afloat i'm afloat and the little boat bumped against the stone princess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1514.mp3	repeated the prince encouraged by seeing her wide awake and looking eagerly at the water well said she without looking round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1515.mp3	and you haven't looked at me once did he then i suppose i must but i am so sleepy sleep then darling and don't mind me said the poor prince
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1516.mp3	replied the princess i think i will go to sleep again just give me a glass of wine and a biscuit first said the prince very humbly with all my heart said the princess and gaped as she said it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1517.mp3	feeling very faint indeed only i shall die before it is of any use to you unless i have something to eat there then said she holding out the wine to him ah you must feed me i dare not move my hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1518.mp3	and she began at once to feed him with bits of biscuit and sips of wine as she fed him he contrived to kiss the tips of her fingers now and then she did not seem to mind it one way or the other but the prince felt better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1519.mp3	now for your own sake princess said he i cannot let you go to sleep you must sit and look at me else i shall not be able to keep up well i will do anything i can to oblige you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1520.mp3	answered she with condescension and sitting down she did look at him and kept looking at him with wonderful steadiness considering all things the sun went down and the moon rose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1521.mp3	and gush after gush the waters were rising up the prince's body they were up to his waist now why can't we go and have a swim said the princess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1522.mp3	i shall never swim more said the prince oh i forgot said the princess and was silent so the water grew and grew and rose up and up on the prince
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1523.mp3	and the princess sat and looked at him she fed him now and then the night wore on the waters rose and rose the moon rose likewise higher and higher
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1524.mp3	and shone full on the face of the dying prince the water was up to his neck will you kiss me princess said he feebly the nonchalance was all gone now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1525.mp3	yes i will answered the princess and kissed him with a long sweet cold kiss now said he with a sigh of content i die happy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1526.mp3	he did not speak again the princess gave him some wine for the last time he was past eating then she sat down again and looked at him the water rose and rose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1527.mp3	it touched his chin it touched his lower lip it touched between his lips he shut them hard to keep it out the princess began to feel strange it touched his upper lip
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1528.mp3	he breathed through his nostrils the princess looked wild it covered his nostrils her eyes looked scared and shone strange in the moonlight his head fell back the water closed over it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1529.mp3	and the bubbles of his last breath bubbled up through the water the princess gave a shriek and sprang into the lake she laid hold first of one leg and then of the other and pulled and tugged but she could not move either she stopped to take breath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1530.mp3	and that made her think that he could not get any breath she was frantic she got hold of him and held his head above the water which was possible now his hands were no longer on the hole but it was of no use for he was past breathing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1531.mp3	love and water brought back all her strength she got under the water and pulled and pulled with her whole might till at last she got one leg out the other easily followed how she got him into the boat she never could tell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1532.mp3	but when she did she fainted away coming to herself she seized the oars kept herself steady as best she could and rowed and rowed though she had never rowed before round rocks and over shallows and through mud she rowed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1533.mp3	till she got to the landing stairs of the palace by this time her people were on the shore for they had heard her shriek she made them carry the prince to her own room and lay him in her bed and light a fire and send for the doctors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1534.mp3	but the lake your highness said the chamberlain who roused by the noise came in in his nightcap go and drown yourself in it she said this was the last rudeness of which the princess was ever guilty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1535.mp3	and one must allow that she had good cause to feel provoked with the lord chamberlain had it been the king himself he would have fared no better but both he and the queen were fast asleep and the chamberlain went back to his bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1536.mp3	somehow the doctors never came so the princess and her old nurse were left with the prince but the old nurse was a wise woman and knew what to do they tried everything for a long time without success
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1537.mp3	the princess was nearly distracted between hope and fear but she tried on and on one thing after another and everything over and over again at last when they had all but given it up just as the sun rose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1538.mp3	the next saturday evening there was much excited discussion at the donnithorne arms concerning an incident which had occurred that very day no less than a second appearance of the smart man in top boots
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1539.mp3	the personal witness to the stranger's visit pronounced contemptuously to be nothing better than a bailiff such as satchell had been before him no one had thought of denying mister casson's testimony to the fact that he had seen the stranger nevertheless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1540.mp3	he proffered various corroborating circumstances i see him myself he said i see him coming along by the crab tree meadow on a bald faced hoss i'd just been t hev a pint
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1541.mp3	and just as i come up by the big ash tree i see the man top boots coming along on a bald faced hoss i wish i may never stir if i didn't and i stood still till he come up and i says good morning sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1542.mp3	i says for i wanted to hear the turn of his tongue as i might know whether he was a this country man so i says good morning sir it ll old hup for the barley this morning i think there'll be a bit got hin if we've good luck

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1547.mp3	and wisely fell back on the previous question which far from being exhausted in a single evening was renewed in the churchyard before service the next day with the fresh interest conferred on all news when there is a fresh person to hear it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1548.mp3	and that fresh hearer was martin poyser who as his wife said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1549.mp3	she always cited it afterwards as a case of prevision which really had something more in it than her own remarkable penetration that the moment she set eyes on the squire she said to herself i shouldna wonder if he's come about that man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1550.mp3	as is a going to take the chase farm wanting poyser to do something for him without pay but poyser's a fool if he does
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1551.mp3	for the old squire's visits to his tenantry were rare and though missus poyser had during the last twelvemonth recited many imaginary speeches meaning even more than met the ear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1552.mp3	the speeches had always remained imaginary good day missus poyser said the old squire peering at her with his short sighted eyes a mode of looking at her which as missus poyser observed allays aggravated me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1553.mp3	it was as if you was a insect and he was going to dab his finger nail on you however she said your servant sir and curtsied with an air of perfect deference as she advanced towards him she was not the woman to misbehave towards her betters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1554.mp3	and fly in the face of the catechism without severe provocation is your husband at home missus poyser yes sir he's only the rick yard i'll send for him in a minute if you'll please to get down and step in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1555.mp3	thank you i will do so i want to consult him about a little matter but you are quite as much concerned in it if not more i must have your opinion too hetty run and tell your uncle to come in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1556.mp3	said missus poyser as they entered the house and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to hetty's curtsy while totty conscious of a pinafore stained with gooseberry jam stood hiding her face against the clock and peeping round furtively
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1557.mp3	what a fine old kitchen this is said mister donnithorne looking round admiringly he always spoke in the same deliberate well chiselled polite way whether his words were sugary or venomous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1558.mp3	and you keep it so exquisitely clean missus poyser i like these premises do you know beyond any on the estate well sir since you're fond of em
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1559.mp3	i should be glad if you'd let a bit o repairs be done to em for the boarding's that state as we're like to be eaten up wi rats and mice and the cellar you may stan up to your knees water in't if you like to go down but perhaps you'd rather believe my words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1560.mp3	not yet i must see your dairy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1561.mp3	on all hands about your fine cheese and butter said the squire looking politely unconscious that there could be any question on which he and missus poyser might happen to disagree i think i see the door open there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1562.mp3	you must not be surprised if i cast a covetous eye on your cream and butter i don't expect that missus satchell's cream and butter will bear comparison with yours i can't say sir i'm sure it's seldom i see other folks's butter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1563.mp3	though there's some on it as one's no need to see the smell's enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1564.mp3	but keeping near the door i'm sure i should like my breakfast better if i knew the butter and cream came from this dairy thank you that really is a pleasant sight unfortunately my slight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1565.mp3	i'll sit down in your comfortable kitchen ah poyser how do you do in the midst of business i see as usual i've been looking at your wife's beautiful dairy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1566.mp3	mister poyser had just entered in shirt sleeves and open waistcoat with a face a shade redder than usual from the exertion of pitching as he stood red rotund and radiant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1567.mp3	said the old gentleman seating himself on a small chair near the door do you know missus poyser sit down pray both of you i've been far from contented for some time with missus satchell's dairy management
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1568.mp3	i think she has not a good method as you have indeed sir i can't speak to that said missus poyser in a hard voice rolling and unrolling her knitting and looking icily out of the window as she continued to stand opposite the squire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1569.mp3	poyser might sit down if he liked she thought she wasn't going to sit down as if she'd give in to any such smooth tongued palaver mister poyser who looked and felt the reverse of icy did sit down in his three cornered chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1570.mp3	and now poyser as satchell is laid up i am intending to let the chase farm to a respectable tenant i'm tired of having a farm on my own hands nothing is made the best of in such cases as you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1571.mp3	said mister poyser with a good natured blankness of imagination as to the nature of the arrangement if i'm called upon to speak sir said missus poyser after glancing at her husband with pity at his softness you know better than me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1572.mp3	not but what i'm glad to hear o anybody respectable coming into the parish there's some
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1573.mp3	you're likely to find mister thurle an excellent neighbour i assure you such a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little plan i'm going to mention especially as i hope you will find it as much to your own advantage as his
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1574.mp3	indeed sir if it's anything t our advantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1575.mp3	i think folks have to wait long enough afore it's brought to em the fact is poyser said the squire ignoring missus poyser's theory of worldly prosperity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1576.mp3	now the plan i'm thinking of is to effect a little exchange if you were to have the hollow pastures you might increase your dairy which must be so profitable under your wife's management and i should request you missus poyser
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1577.mp3	than corn land mister poyser was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees his head on one side and his mouth screwed up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1578.mp3	he was much too acute a man not to see through the whole business and to foresee perfectly what would be his wife's view of the subject but he disliked giving unpleasant answers unless it was on a point of farming practice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1579.mp3	he would rather give up than have a quarrel any day and after all it mattered more to his wife than to him so after a few moments silence he looked up at her and said mildly what dost say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1580.mp3	missus poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity during his silence but now she turned away her head with a toss looked icily at the opposite roof of the cow shed and spearing her knitting together with the loose pin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1581.mp3	held it firmly between her clasped hands say why i say you may do as you like
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1582.mp3	i know there's them as is born t own the land and them as is born to sweat on't here missus poyser paused to gasp a little and i know it's christened folks's duty to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1583.mp3	blood ull bear it but i'll not make a martyr o myself and wear myself to skin and bone and worret myself as if i was a churn wi butter a coming in't for no landlord in england not if he was king george himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1584.mp3	no no my dear missus poyser certainly not said the squire still confident in his own powers of persuasion you must not overwork yourself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1585.mp3	but don't you think your work will rather be lessened than increased in this way there is so much milk required at the abbey that you will have little increase of cheese and butter making from the addition to your dairy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1586.mp3	that it was not in this case a purely abstract question i daresay said missus poyser bitterly turning her head half way towards her husband and looking at the vacant arm chair i daresay it's true for men

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1591.mp3	that difficulty about the fetching and carrying you will not have missus poyser said the squire who thought that this entrance into particulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on missus poyser's part
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1592.mp3	bethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony oh sir begging your pardon i've never been used t having gentlefolks's servants coming about my back places a making love to both the gells at once

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1621.mp3	let us all sit down adam took his chair again mechanically and bartle for whom there was no chair remaining sat on the bed in the background have you seen her sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1622.mp3	yes adam i and the chaplain have both been with her this evening did you ask her sir did you say anything about me yes said mister irwine with some hesitation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1623.mp3	it is not only you some fatal influence seems to have shut up her heart against her fellow creatures she has scarcely said anything more than no either to me or the chaplain three or four days ago before you were mentioned to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1624.mp3	when i asked her if there was any one of her family whom she would like to see to whom she could open her mind she said with a violent shudder tell them not to come near me i won't see any of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1625.mp3	if they now urge you strongly to go and see her to morrow morning even without her consent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1626.mp3	that the interview might affect her favourably but i grieve to say i have scarcely any hope of that she didn't seem agitated when i mentioned your name she only said no in the same cold obstinate way as usual
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1627.mp3	and if the meeting had no good effect on her it would be pure useless suffering to you severe suffering i fear she is very much changed adam started up from his chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1628.mp3	and seized his hat which lay on the table but he stood still then and looked at mister irwine as if he had a question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter bartle massey rose quietly turned the key in the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1629.mp3	and put it in his pocket is he come back said adam at last no he is not said mister irwine quietly lay down your hat adam unless you like to walk out with me for a little fresh air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1630.mp3	i fear you have not been out again to day you needn't deceive me sir said adam looking hard at mister irwine and speaking in a tone of angry suspicion you needn't be afraid of me i only want justice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1631.mp3	i want him to feel what she feels it's his work she was a child as it ud ha gone t anybody's heart to look at i don't care what she's done it was him brought her to it and he shall know it he shall feel it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1632.mp3	to sin and misery i'm not deceiving you adam said mister irwine arthur donnithorne is not come back was not come back when i left i have left a letter for him he will know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1633.mp3	he will know he will suffer long and bitterly he has a heart and a conscience i can't be entirely deceived in his character i am convinced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1634.mp3	he may be weak but he is not callous not coldly selfish i am persuaded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1635.mp3	all his life why do you crave vengeance in this way no amount of torture that you could inflict on him could benefit her no o god no adam groaned out sinking on his chair again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1636.mp3	but then that's the deepest curse of all that's what makes the blackness of it it can never be undone my poor hetty she can never be my sweet hetty again the prettiest thing god had made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1637.mp3	smiling up at me i thought she loved me and was good adam's voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone as if he were only talking to himself but now he said abruptly looking at mister irwine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1638.mp3	but she isn't as guilty as they say you don't think she is sir she can't ha done it that perhaps can never be known with certainty adam mister irwine answered gently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1639.mp3	in these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what seems to us strong evidence and yet for want of knowing some small fact our judgment is wrong but suppose the worst you have no right to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1640.mp3	that the guilt of her crime lies with him and that he ought to bear the punishment it is not for us men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution we find it impossible to avoid mistakes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1641.mp3	even in determining who has committed a single criminal act and the problem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1642.mp3	you have a mind that can understand this fully adam when you are calm don't suppose i can't enter into the anguish that drives you into this state of revengeful hatred but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1643.mp3	for it is passion and you deceive yourself in calling it justice it might be with you precisely as it has been with arthur nay worse your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1644.mp3	no not worse said adam bitterly i don't believe it's worse i'd sooner do it i'd sooner do a wickedness as i could suffer for by myself than ha brought her to do wickedness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1645.mp3	and then stand by and see em punish her while they let me alone and all for a bit o pleasure as if he'd had a man's heart in him he'd ha cut his hand off sooner than he'd ha taken it what if he didn't foresee what's happened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1646.mp3	he foresaw enough he'd no right to expect anything but harm and shame to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1647.mp3	not half so hateful as that let a man do what he will if he knows he's to bear the punishment himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1648.mp3	and knows all the while the punishment ll fall on somebody else there again you partly deceive yourself adam there is no sort of wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone you can't isolate yourself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1649.mp3	i feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of arthur's has caused to others but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it an act of vengeance on your part against arthur would simply be another evil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1650.mp3	added to those we are suffering under you could not bear the punishment alone you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you you would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1651.mp3	as long as you do not see that to fix your mind on arthur's punishment is revenge and not justice you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong remember what you told me about your feelings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1652.mp3	after you had given that blow to arthur in the grove adam was silent the last words had called up a vivid image of the past and mister irwine left him to his thoughts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1653.mp3	while he spoke to bartle massey about old mister donnithorne's funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind but at length adam turned round and said in a more subdued tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1654.mp3	is dinah morris come to em sir seth said they'd sent for her no mister poyser tells me she was not come when he left they're afraid the letter has not reached her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1655.mp3	it seems they had no exact address adam sat ruminating a little while and then said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1656.mp3	but perhaps the poysers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1657.mp3	since they won't come nigh her themselves but i think she would for the methodists are great folks for going into the prisons and seth said he thought she would she'd a very tender way with her dinah had
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1658.mp3	you never saw her sir did you yes i did i had a conversation with her she pleased me a good deal and now you mention it i wish she would come for it is possible that a gentle mild woman like her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1659.mp3	if i'd thought of it earlier i would have taken some measures for finding her out said mister irwine but it's too late now i fear well adam i must go now try to get some rest to night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1660.mp3	there was great rejoicing in the little village in the pond when brownie beaver returned with the good news that there would be no more hunting and fishing and when old grandaddy beaver said that everybody ought to take a holiday to celebrate the occasion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1661.mp3	all the villagers said it was a fine idea so they stopped working for once and began to plan the celebration they thought that there ought to be swimming races and tree felling contests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1662.mp3	and brownie beaver said that after the holiday was over he would suggest that someone be chosen to go down and thank farmer green for putting the notice on the tree the whole village agreed to brownie's proposal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1663.mp3	brownie beaver himself passed his hat around to take up the votes and it was quickly found that every vote was for brownie beaver he had even voted for himself but no one seemed to care about that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1664.mp3	and another in which each person who took part had to stay beneath the surface as long as he could that last race caused some trouble a young scamp called slippery sam won it and many people thought that he had swum up inside his house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1665.mp3	where he could get air without being seen but no one could prove it so he won the race just the same next came the tree felling contest there were six including brownie beaver that took part in it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1666.mp3	grandaddy beaver had picked out six trees of exactly the same size each person in the contest had to try to bring his tree to the ground first and that caused some trouble too because some claimed that their trees were of harder wood than others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1667.mp3	and more difficult to gnaw while others complained that the bark of their trees tasted very bitter and of course that made their task unpleasant those six trees falling one after another made such a racket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1668.mp3	that old mister crow heard the noise miles away and flew over to see what was happening after everybody crept out of his hiding place some time afterward everyone had to hide for a while you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1669.mp3	there was mister crow sitting upon one of the fallen trees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1670.mp3	then they told him about the celebration and mister crow began to laugh what are you going to do next he asked we're a going to send brownie beaver over to pleasant valley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1671.mp3	to thank farmer green for his kindness in putting an end to hunting and fishing said old grandaddy beaver and he's a going to start right away mister crow looked around and there was brownie beaver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1672.mp3	with a lunch basket in his hand all ready to begin his long journey say good by to him then said mister crow for you'll never see him again what do you mean grandaddy beaver asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1673.mp3	and as for brownie he was so frightened that he dropped his basket right in the water i mean said mister crow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1674.mp3	you don't seem to have understood that sign in the first place it was not farmer green but his son johnnie who nailed it to the tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1675.mp3	that is why one of the words was misspelled no doubt mister crow remarked as a matter of fact not being able to read he hadn't known about the word that was spelled wrong in the second place he continued
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1676.mp3	the sign doesn't mean that hunting and fishing are to be stopped it means that no one but johnnie green is going to hunt and fish in this neighborhood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1677.mp3	and instead of hunting and fishing being stopped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1678.mp3	he added that johnnie green had a new gun on this birthday brownie beaver said at once that he was not going on the errand of thanks i resign he said and anyone that wants to go in my place is welcome to do so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1679.mp3	but nobody cared to go and the whole village seemed greatly disappointed until grandaddy beaver made a short speech

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1682.mp3	and then with his forty slaves started for the new orleans market as many of the slaves had been brought up in richmond and had relations residing there the slave trader determined to leave the city early in the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1683.mp3	so as not to witness any of those scenes so common where slaves are separated from their relatives and friends when about departing for the southern market this plan was successful for not even clotel who had been every day at the prison to see her mother and sister
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1684.mp3	knew of their departure a march of eight days through the interior of the state and they arrived on the banks of the ohio river where they were all put on board a steamer and then speedily sailed for the place of their destination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1685.mp3	walker had already advertised in the new orleans papers that he would be there at a stated time with a prime lot of able bodied slaves ready for field service together with a few extra ones between the ages of fifteen and twenty five
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1686.mp3	but like most who make a business of buying and selling slaves for gain he often bought some who were far advanced in years and would always try to sell them for five or ten years younger than they actually were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1687.mp3	few persons can arrive at anything like the age of a negro by mere observation unless they are well acquainted with the race therefore the slave trader very frequently carried out this deception with perfect impunity after the steamer had left the wharf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1688.mp3	and instructed him as to getting the negroes ready for market amongst the forty negroes were several whose appearance indicated that they had seen some years and had gone through some services
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1689.mp3	their grey hair and whiskers at once pronounced them to be above the ages set down in the trader's advertisement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1690.mp3	and if he did not take delight in discharging his duty he did it with a degree of alacrity so that he might receive the approbation of his master pomp as walker usually called him was of real negro blood and would often say when alluding to himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1691.mp3	dis nigger is no countefit he is de genewine artekil

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1693.mp3	that he appeared perfectly indifferent to the heartrending scenes which daily occurred in his presence it was on the second day of the steamer's voyage that pompey selected five of the old slaves took them in a room by themselves and commenced preparing them for the market
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1694.mp3	well said pompey addressing himself to the company i is de gentman dat is to get you ready so dat you will bring marser a good price in de orleans market how old is you

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1703.mp3	and everything indicated that a steamboat race was at hand nothing can exceed the excitement attendant upon a steamboat race on the mississippi river by the time the boats had reached memphis they were side by side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1704.mp3	and each exerting itself to keep the ascendancy in point of speed the night was clear the moon shining brightly and the boats so near to each other that the passengers were calling out from one boat to the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1705.mp3	on board the patriot the firemen were using oil lard butter and even bacon with the wood for the purpose of raising the steam to its highest pitch the blaze mingled with the black smoke showed plainly that the other boat was burning more than wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1706.mp3	the two boats soon locked so that the hands of the boats were passing from vessel to vessel and the wildest excitement prevailed throughout amongst both passengers and crew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1707.mp3	at this moment the engineer of the patriot was seen to fasten down the safety valve so that no steam should escape this was indeed a dangerous resort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1708.mp3	the patriot stopped to take in passengers and still no steam was permitted to escape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1709.mp3	and as might have been expected one of the boilers immediately exploded one dense fog of steam filled every part of the vessel while shrieks groans and cries were heard on every hand the saloons and cabins soon had the appearance of a hospital
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1710.mp3	by this time the boat had landed and the columbia the other boat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1711.mp3	the killed and scalded nineteen in number

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1740.mp3	brownie was in a great hurry for saturday to arrive in order to make no mistake he put aside a stick in which he gnawed a notch each day and in that way he knew exactly when saturday came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1741.mp3	that was probably the longest day in brownie beaver's life at least it seemed so to him whenever he saw a bird soaring above the tree tops he couldn't help hoping it was mister crow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1742.mp3	brownie beaver dropped whatever he happened to be doing expecting that mister crow would flap into sight at any moment brownie had many disappointments but mister crow really came at last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1743.mp3	he lighted right on top of brownie beaver's house and called paper down the chimney just like that brownie happened to be inside his house and in a wonderfully short time his head appeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1744.mp3	above the water and he soon crawled up beside mister crow well i am glad to see you he told mister crow peter mink caught a monstrous eel in the duck pond on monday mister crow said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1745.mp3	being a newspaper he thought he ought to say nothing except what was news not even good afternoon mister rabbit of pine ridge with his wife and fourteen children is visiting his brother mister jeremiah rabbit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1746.mp3	mister crow continued to relate in a singsong voice goodness gracious brownie beaver exclaimed fatty coon mister crow said fatty coon was confined to his house by illness tuesday night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1747.mp3	he ate too many dried apples well well brownie beaver murmured and he started to ask mister crow a question but mister crow interrupted him with more news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1748.mp3	missus bear had a birthday on wednesday an enjoyable time was had by all except the pig pig brownie beaver asked what pig the pig they ate said mister crow

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1751.mp3	and he left faster than he came brownie beaver wanted to know where tommy fox made his visit at farmer green's hen house mister crow explained why did he hurry away brownie asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1752.mp3	old dog spot chased him mister crow replied but you mustn't ask questions he complained you can't ask questions of a newspaper you know well what happened on saturday
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1753.mp3	another question i declare i don't believe you ever took a newspaper before did you brownie beaver admitted that he never had then said mister crow then don't interrupt me again please

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1755.mp3	he was afraid that if he said another word mister crow would grow angry and fly away without telling him any more news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1756.mp3	jimmy rabbit almost cut off frisky squirrel's tail mister crow paused and looked at brownie beaver out of the corner of his eye he knew that brownie would want to know what prevented the accident but he was in no hurry to tell him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1757.mp3	for a few moments brownie waited to hear the rest but a few moments was more than he could endure why didn't jimmy cut off his tail brownie asked eagerly there said mister crow you've done just as i told you not to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1758.mp3	so i shall not tell you the rest until next saturday you see you have a few things to learn about taking a newspaper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1759.mp3	was not the only village to be seen from blue mountain there was another which farmer green seldom visited because it lay beyond the mountain and was a long distance from his house though he owned the land where it stood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1760.mp3	those that lived there thought they had every right to stay there as long as they pleased without being disturbed it was in this village that brownie beaver and his neighbors lived it was a different sort of town too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1761.mp3	from the one where farmer green went each week over beyond blue mountain all the houses were built in a pond and all their doors were under water but nobody minded that because like brownie beaver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1762.mp3	everybody that dwelt there was a fine swimmer years and years before brownie's time his forefathers had come there and finding that there were many trees in the neighborhood with the sort of bark they liked to eat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1763.mp3	such as poplars willows and box elders they had decided that it was a good place to live there was a small stream too which was really the beginning of swift river
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1764.mp3	and by damming it those old settlers made a pond in which they could build their houses they had ideas of their own as to what a house should be like
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1765.mp3	though you perhaps might not care for them at all they wanted their houses to be surrounded by water because they thought they were safer when built in that manner and they always insisted that a door leading into a house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1766.mp3	should be far beneath the surface of the water for they believed that that made a house safer too to you such an idea may seem very strange but if you were chased by an enemy you might be glad to be able to swim under water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1767.mp3	down to the bottom of a pond and slip inside a door which led to a winding hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1768.mp3	of course your enemy might be able to swim as well as you but maybe he would think twice or even three times before he went prowling through your crooked hall for if you had enormous strong sharp teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1769.mp3	with which you could gnaw right through a tree he would not care to have you seize him as he poked his head around a corner in a dark passage of a strange house it was in a house of that kind that brownie beaver lived
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1770.mp3	and he built it himself because he said he would rather have a neat new house than one of the big old dwellings that had been built many years before when his great great grandfather had helped throw the dam across the stream the dam was there still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1771.mp3	it was so old that trees were growing on it and there was an odd thing about it it was never finished though brownie beaver was a young chap he worked on the dam sometimes like all his neighbors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1772.mp3	you see the villagers kept making the dam wider and since it was built of sticks and mud the water sometimes washed bits of it away so it had to be kept in repair if brownie beaver and his friends had neglected their dam
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1773.mp3	and without any water to hide their doorways they would have been safe no longer they would have had no place either to store their winter's food for they were in the habit of cutting down trees and saving the bark and branches too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1774.mp3	in order to have plenty to eat when cold weather came and the ice closed their pond some of their food they carried into their houses through a straight hall which was made for that very purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1775.mp3	and some of the branches they fastened under water near the dam it was just like putting green things into a refrigerator so they will keep now you see why brownie beaver would no more have thought of building his house on dry land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1776.mp3	than you would think of building one in a pond everybody likes his own way best and it never once occurred to brownie beaver that his way was the least bit strange
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1777.mp3	and their mother was leda who after the twin brothers had another child born to her helen for whose sake the sons of many of jason's friends were to wage war against the great city of troy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1778.mp3	in quest of the golden fleece and then there came one who had both welcome and reverence from jason this one came without spear or bow bearing in his hands a lyre only he was orpheus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1779.mp3	and he knew all the ways of the gods and all the stories of the gods when he sang to his lyre the trees would listen and the beasts would follow him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1780.mp3	chiron the centaur had met him as he was wandering through the forests on the mountain pelion and had sent him down into iolcus then there came two men well skilled in the handling of ships tiphys and nauplius
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1781.mp3	tiphys knew all about the sun and winds and stars and all about the signs by which a ship might be steered and nauplius had the love of poseidon the god of the sea afterward there came one after the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1782.mp3	two who were famous for their hunting no two could be more different than these two were the first was arcas he was dressed in the skin of a bear he had red hair and savage looking eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1783.mp3	and for arms he carried a mighty bow with bronze tipped arrows the folk were watching an eagle as he came into the city an eagle that was winging its way far far up in the sky arcas drew his bow and with one arrow he brought the eagle down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1784.mp3	and then he was the oldest of the heroes in the camp of agamemnon two brothers came who were to be special friends of jason's peleus and telamon both were still youthful and neither had yet achieved any notable deed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1785.mp3	another who came was admetus afterward he became a famous king the god apollo once made himself a shepherd and he kept the flocks of king admetus and there came two brothers twins who were a wonder to all who beheld them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1786.mp3	their mother was oreithyia the daughter of erechtheus king of athens and their father was boreas the north wind these two brothers had on their ankles wings that gleamed with golden scales their black hair was thick upon their shoulders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1787.mp3	whose name was theseus theseus's father was an unknown king he had bidden the mother show their son where his sword was hidden under a great stone the king had hidden it before theseus was born
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1788.mp3	on the day that the messengers had set out to bring through greece the word of jason's going forth in quest of the golden fleece
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1789.mp3	they began to fell trees for the timbers of the ship that was to make the voyage to far colchis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1790.mp3	the harbor of iolcus on the night of the day he had helped to bring them down jason had a dream he dreamt that she whom he had seen in the forest ways and afterward by the river anaurus appeared to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1791.mp3	he went to the city's gate and he met such a man argus was his name he told jason that a dream had sent him to the city of iolcus jason welcomed him and lodged him in the king's palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1792.mp3	jason had them take the beam from the roof of the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1793.mp3	and that day the building of the great ship was begun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1794.mp3	came the noise of hammering in the street where the metalworkers were came the noise of beating upon metals as the smiths fashioned out of bronze armor for the heroes and swords and spears every day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1795.mp3	under the eyes of argus the master the ship that had in it the beam from zeus's grove was built higher and wider and those who were building the ship often felt going through it tremors as of a living creature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1796.mp3	when the ship was built and made ready for the voyage a name was given to it the argo it was called
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1797.mp3	all was ready for the voyage and now jason went with his friends to view the ship before she was brought into the water argus the master was on the ship seeing to it that the last things were being done before argo was launched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1798.mp3	very grave and wise looked argus argus the builder of the ship and wonderful to the heroes the ship looked now that argus for their viewing had set up the mast with the sails and had even put the oars in their places
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1799.mp3	wonderful to the heroes argo looked with her long oars and her high sails with her timbers painted red and gold and blue and with a marvelous figure carved upon her prow all over the ship jason's eyes went
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1800.mp3	he saw a figure standing by the mast for a moment he looked on it and then the figure became shadowy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1801.mp3	then mast and sails were taken down and the oars were left in the ship and the argo was launched into the water the heroes went back to the palace of king pelias to feast with the king's guests before they took their places on the ship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1802.mp3	setting out on the voyage to far colchis when they came into the palace they saw that another hero had arrived his shield was hung in the hall the heroes all gathered around amazed at the size and the beauty of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1803.mp3	strife and pursuit and flight tumult and panic and slaughter the figure of fate was there dragging a dead man by the feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1804.mp3	around these figures were heads of snakes heads with black jaws and glittering eyes twelve heads such as might affright any man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1805.mp3	there were men fighting and women watching from high towers the awful figure of the darkness of death was shown there too with mournful eyes and the dust of battles upon her shoulders the outer rim of the shield
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1806.mp3	showed the stream of ocean the stream that encircles the world swans were soaring above and swimming on its surface all in wonder the heroes gazed on the great shield telling each other that only one man in all the world could carry it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1807.mp3	but in the midst of gaiety his heart yearned all the while for his lost love and his merriment was but mourning in disguise at last the night wore on and as he was retiring along the corridor he saw a man of about forty years of age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1808.mp3	with long hair coming towards him who when he saw genzaburo cried out dear me why this must be my young lord genzaburo who has come out to enjoy himself genzaburo thought this rather strange but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1809.mp3	looking at the man attentively recognized him as a retainer whom he had had in his employ the year before and said this is a curious meeting pray what have you been about since you left my service at any rate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1810.mp3	i may congratulate you on being well and strong where are you living now well sir since i parted from you i have been earning a living as a fortune teller at kanda and have changed my name to kaji sazen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1811.mp3	i am living in a poor and humble house but if your lordship at your leisure would honour me with a visit well it's a lucky chance that has brought us together and i certainly will go and see you besides i want you to do something for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1812.mp3	shall you be at home the day after to morrow certainly sir i shall make a point of being at home very well then the day after to morrow i will go to your house i shall be at your service sir and now as it is getting late
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1813.mp3	i will take my leave for to night good night then we shall meet the day after to morrow and so the two parted and went their several ways to rest on the appointed day genzaburo made his preparations and went in disguise without any retainers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1814.mp3	to call upon sazen who met him at the porch of his house and said this is a great honour my lord genzaburo is indeed welcome my house is very mean but let me invite your lordship to come into an inner chamber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1815.mp3	pray replied genzaburo don't make any ceremony for me don't put yourself to any trouble on my account and so he passed in and sazen called to his wife to prepare wine and condiments and they began to feast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1816.mp3	at last genzaburo looking sazen in the face said there is a service which i want you to render me a very secret service but as if you were to refuse me i should be put to shame before i tell you what that service is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1817.mp3	well then said genzaburo greatly pleased and drawing ten riyos from his bosom this is but a small present to make to you on my first visit but pray accept it no indeed i don't know what your lordship wishes of me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1818.mp3	how he had first met her and fallen in love with her at the adzuma bridge how chokichi had introduced her to him at the tea house at oji and then when she fell ill and he wanted to see her again instead of bringing her to him had only given him good advice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1819.mp3	and so genzaburo drew a lamentable picture of his state of despair sazen listened patiently to his story and after reflecting for a while replied well sir it's not a difficult matter to set right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1820.mp3	when genzaburo heard this he felt greatly relieved and recommending sazen to do his best in the matter took his leave and returned home that very night sazen after thinking over all that genzaburo had told him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1821.mp3	laid his plans accordingly and went off to the house of kihachi the eta chief and told him the commission with which he had been entrusted kihachi was of course greatly astonished and said some time ago sir chokichi came here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1822.mp3	and said that my lord genzaburo having been rebuked by his family for his profligate behaviour had determined to break off his connection with my daughter of course i knew that the daughter of an eta was no fitting match for a nobleman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1823.mp3	so when chokichi came and told me the errand upon which he had been sent i had no alternative but to announce to my daughter that she must give up all thought of his lordship since that time she has been fretting and pining and starving for love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1824.mp3	but when i tell her what you have just said how glad and happy she will be let me go and talk to her at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1825.mp3	well at any rate i have some news for you that will make you happy a messenger has come from my lord genzaburo for whom your heart yearns at this o koyo who had been crouching down like a drooping flower gave a great start and cried out is that really true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1826.mp3	it is chokichi who has been throwing obstacles in the way at last his lordship has secretly sent a man called kaji sazen a fortune teller to arrange an interview between you so now my child you may cheer up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1827.mp3	and go to meet your lover as soon as you please when o koyo heard this she was so happy that she thought it must all be a dream and doubted her own senses kihachi in the meanwhile rejoined sazen in the other room and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1828.mp3	after telling him of the joy with which his daughter had heard the news put before him wine and other delicacies i think said sazen that the best way would be for o koyo to live secretly in my lord genzaburo's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1829.mp3	but as it will never do for all the world to know of it it must be managed very quietly and further when i get home i must think out some plan to lull the suspicions of that fellow chokichi and let you know my idea by letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1830.mp3	meanwhile o koyo had better come home with me to night although she is so terribly out of spirits now she shall meet genzaburo the day after to morrow kihachi reported this to o koyo and as her pining for genzaburo was the only cause of her sickness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1831.mp3	she recovered her spirits at once and saying that she would go with sazen immediately joyfully made her preparations then sazen having once more warned kihachi to keep the matter secret from chokichi and to act upon the letter which he should send him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1832.mp3	returned home taking with him o koyo and after o koyo had bathed and dressed her hair and painted herself and put on beautiful clothes she came out looking so lovely that no princess in the land could vie with her and sazen when he saw her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1833.mp3	said to himself that it was no wonder that genzaburo had fallen in love with her then as it was getting late he advised her to go to rest and after showing her to her apartments went to his own room and wrote his letter to kihachi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1834.mp3	containing the scheme which he had devised when kihachi received his instructions he was filled with admiration at sazen's ingenuity and putting on an appearance of great alarm and agitation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1835.mp3	went off immediately to call on chokichi and said to him oh master chokichi such a terrible thing has happened pray let me tell you all about it indeed what can it be oh sir answered kihachi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1836.mp3	pretending to wipe away his tears my daughter o koyo mourning over her separation from my lord genzaburo at first refused all sustenance and remained nursing her sorrows until last night her woman's heart failing to bear up against her great grief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1837.mp3	she drowned herself in the river leaving behind her a paper on which she had written her intention when chokichi heard this he was thunderstruck and exclaimed can this really be true and when i think that it was i who first introduced her to my lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1838.mp3	i am ashamed to look you in the face oh say not so misfortunes are the punishment due for our misdeeds in a former state of existence i bear you no ill will this money which i hold in my hand was my daughter's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1839.mp3	to you through whose intervention she became allied with a nobleman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1840.mp3	you amaze me replied the other how could i above all men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1841.mp3	at last chokichi after much persuasion and greatly to his own distress was obliged to accept the money and when kihachi had carried out all sazen's instructions he returned home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1842.mp3	and as luck would have it it was the very letter which contained sazen's instructions to kihachi and in which the whole story which had just affected him so much was made up when he perceived the trick that had been played upon him he was very angry and exclaimed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1843.mp3	and all in vain well they've gulled me once but i'll be even with them yet and hinder their game before it is played out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1844.mp3	and went off secretly to prowl about sazen's house to watch for o koyo determined to pay off genzaburo and sazen for their conduct to him in the meanwhile sazen who did not for a moment suspect what had happened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1845.mp3	when the day which had been fixed upon by him and genzaburo arrived made o koyo put on her best clothes smartened up his house and got ready a feast against genzaburo's arrival the latter came punctually to his time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1846.mp3	and going in at once said to the fortune teller
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1847.mp3	lost heart entirely and made up his mind to go home again sazen however pressed him so eagerly that at last he went upstairs to see this vaunted beauty and sazen drawing aside a screen showed him o koyo who was sitting there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1848.mp3	pray don't mention it sir but as it is a long time since you have met the young lady you must have a great deal to say to one another so i will go downstairs and if you want anything pray call me and so he went downstairs and left them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1849.mp3	then genzaburo addressing o koyo said ah it is indeed a long time since we met how happy it makes me to see you again why your face has grown quite thin poor thing have you been unhappy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1850.mp3	and o koyo with the tears starting from her eyes for joy hid her face and her heart was so full that she could not speak but genzaburo passing his hand gently over her head and back and comforting her said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1851.mp3	come sweetheart there is no need to sob so talk to me a little and let me hear your voice at last o koyo raised her head and said ah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1852.mp3	and thought that i should never meet you again how tenderly i thought of you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1853.mp3	sazen came with a message from you i thought it was all a dream and as she spoke she bent her head and sobbed again and in genzaburo's eyes she seemed more beautiful than ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1854.mp3	with her pale delicate face and he loved her better than before then she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1855.mp3	i should never stop yes replied genzaburo i too have suffered much and so they told one another their mutual griefs and from that day forth they constantly met at sazen's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1856.mp3	one day as they were feasting and enjoying themselves in an upper storey in sazen's house chokichi came to the house and said i beg pardon but does one master sazen live here certainly sir i am sazen at your service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1857.mp3	and my name is chokichi i beg to bespeak your goodwill for myself i hope we may be friends sazen was not a little taken aback at this however he put on an innocent face as though he had never heard of chokichi before and said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1858.mp3	i never heard of such a thing why i thought you were some respectable person and you have the impudence to tell me that your name is chokichi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1859.mp3	to think of such a shameless villain coming and asking to be friends with me forsooth get you gone the quicker the better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1860.mp3	why i thought you must be one of us insolent knave begone as fast as possible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1861.mp3	you had better get rid of o koyo as well i suppose she must equally be a pollution to it this put sazen rather in a dilemma however he made up his mind not to show any hesitation and said what are you talking about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1862.mp3	there is no o koyo here and i never saw such a person in my life chokichi quietly drew out of the bosom of his dress the letter from sazen to kihachi which he had picked up a few days before and showing it to sazen replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1863.mp3	and as he pretended to leave the house sazen at his wits end cried out stop stop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1864.mp3	pray stop and listen quietly it is quite true as you said that o koyo is in my house and really your indignation is perfectly just come let us talk over matters a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1865.mp3	in order that i may be revenged for the fraud that was put upon me won't you accept twenty five riyos twenty five riyos no indeed i will not take a fraction less than a hundred and if i cannot get them i will report the whole matter at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1866.mp3	sazen after a moment's consideration hit upon a scheme and answered smiling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1867.mp3	you shall have the hundred riyos you ask for but as i have not so much money by me at present i will go to genzaburo's house and fetch it it's getting dark now but it's not very late
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1868.mp3	so i'll trouble you to come with me and then i can give you the money to night chokichi consenting to this the pair left the house together now sazen who as a ronin wore a long dirk in his girdle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1869.mp3	kept looking out for a moment when chokichi should be off his guard in order to kill him but chokichi kept his eyes open and did not give sazen a chance at last chokichi as ill luck would have it stumbled against a stone and fell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1870.mp3	and sazen profiting by the chance drew his dirk and stabbed him in the side and as chokichi taken by surprise tried to get up he cut him severely over the head until at last he fell dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1871.mp3	sazen then looking around him and seeing to his great delight that there was no one near returned home the following day chokichi's body was found by the police and when they examined it they found nothing upon it save a paper which they read
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1872.mp3	and which proved to be the very letter which sazen had sent to kihachi and which chokichi had picked up the matter was immediately reported to the governor and sazen having been summoned an investigation was held
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1873.mp3	sazen cunning and bold murderer as he was lost his self possession when he saw what a fool he had been not to get back from chokichi the letter which he had written and when he was put to a rigid examination under torture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1874.mp3	confessed that he had hidden o koyo at genzaburo's instigation and then killed chokichi who had found out the secret upon this the governor after consulting about genzaburo's case decided that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1875.mp3	as he had disgraced his position as a hatamoto by contracting an alliance with the daughter of an eta his property should be confiscated his family blotted out and himself banished as for kihachi the eta chief and his daughter o koyo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1876.mp3	and by him they too were banished while sazen against whom the murder of chokichi had been fully proved was executed according to law note at asakusa in yedo there lives a man called danzayemon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1877.mp3	this man traces his pedigree back to minamoto no yoritomo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1878.mp3	the thirty sixth law provides as follows all wandering mendicants such as male sorcerers female diviners hermits blind people beggars and tanners etas have had from of old their respective rulers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1879.mp3	be not disinclined however to punish any such who give rise to disputes or who overstep the boundaries of their own classes and are disobedient to existing laws
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1880.mp3	and if they are very poor they wander from house to house working as cobblers mending old shoes and leather and so earn a scanty livelihood besides this their daughters and young married women gain a trifle as wandering minstrels called torioi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1881.mp3	playing on the shamisen a sort of banjo and singing ballads they never marry out of their own fraternity but remain apart a despised and shunned race at executions by crucifixion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1882.mp3	and besides this they have to perform all sorts of degrading offices about criminals such as carrying sick prisoners from their cells to the hall of justice and burying the bodies of those that have been executed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1883.mp3	thus their race is polluted and accursed and they are hated accordingly now this is how the etas came to be under the jurisdiction of danzayemon when minamoto no yoritomo was yet a child his father minamoto no yoshitomo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1884.mp3	but kiyomori desiring to destroy the family of yoshitomo root and branch ordered his retainers to divide themselves into bands and seek out the children at last they were found but tokiwa was so exceedingly beautiful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1885.mp3	that kiyomori was inflamed with love for her and desired her to become his own concubine then tokiwa told kiyomori that if he would spare her little ones she would share his couch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1886.mp3	but that if he killed her children she would destroy herself rather than yield to his desire when he heard this kiyomori bewildered by the beauty of tokiwa spared the lives of her children but banished them from the capital
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1887.mp3	and when he grew up and became a man he married the daughter of a peasant after a while yoritomo left the province and went to the wars leaving his wife pregnant and in due time she was delivered of a male child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1888.mp3	to the delight of her parents who rejoiced that their daughter should bear seed to a nobleman but she soon fell sick and died and the old people took charge of the babe and when they also died the care of the child fell to his mother's kinsmen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1889.mp3	and he grew up to be a peasant now kiyomori the enemy of yoritomo had been gathered to his fathers and yoritomo had avenged the death of his father by slaying munemori the son of kiyomori and there was peace throughout the land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1890.mp3	and yoritomo became the chief of all the noble houses in japan and first established the government of the country when yoritomo had thus raised himself to power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1891.mp3	and his descendants after him lived as peasants in the same village increasing in prosperity and in good repute among their neighbours but the princely line of yoritomo came to an end in three generations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1892.mp3	so he summoned him and said it is a hard thing to see the son of an illustrious house live and die a peasant i will promote you to the rank of samurai then the peasant answered my lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1893.mp3	if i become a samurai and the retainer of some noble i shall not be so happy as when i was my own master if i may not remain a husbandman let me be a chief over men however humble they may be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1894.mp3	and thinking to punish the peasant for his insolence said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1895.mp3	i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1896.mp3	which influenced their actions the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1897.mp3	this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1898.mp3	employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1899.mp3	and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1900.mp3	they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1901.mp3	it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1902.mp3	they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one another's company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1903.mp3	a considerable period elapsed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1904.mp3	it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1905.mp3	when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1906.mp3	this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1907.mp3	i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1908.mp3	and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1909.mp3	the young woman when she opened the door in the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1910.mp3	she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1911.mp3	by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1912.mp3	i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1913.mp3	but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1914.mp3	not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1915.mp3	and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse i learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1916.mp3	but the old man had only one which was father the girl was called sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot describe the delight i felt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1917.mp3	when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1918.mp3	as yet to understand or apply them such as good dearest unhappy i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1919.mp3	when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathized in their joys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1920.mp3	often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1921.mp3	agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1922.mp3	and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1923.mp3	but if his countenance was more sorrowful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1924.mp3	especially when he addressed the old man i could mention innumerable instances which although slight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1925.mp3	in the midst of poverty and want
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1926.mp3	from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1927.mp3	where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1928.mp3	he read to the old man and agatha this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1929.mp3	that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1930.mp3	of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1931.mp3	to discover myself to the cottagers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1932.mp3	which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1933.mp3	as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1934.mp3	from this time felix was more employed and the heart moving indications of impending famine disappeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1935.mp3	and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced the old man leaning on his son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1936.mp3	my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1937.mp3	when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was star light
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1938.mp3	and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1939.mp3	my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought foolish wretch

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1941.mp3	i imagined that they would be disgusted until
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1942.mp3	and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1943.mp3	greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1944.mp3	happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1945.mp3	my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1946.mp3	chapter eleven it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1947.mp3	by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1948.mp3	the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1949.mp3	the light became more and more oppressive to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1950.mp3	this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1951.mp3	i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1952.mp3	as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1953.mp3	i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1954.mp3	i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1955.mp3	the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1956.mp3	no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1957.mp3	the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1958.mp3	i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1959.mp3	which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1960.mp3	and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1961.mp3	sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1962.mp3	the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1963.mp3	my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1964.mp3	one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1965.mp3	in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1966.mp3	the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1967.mp3	and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1968.mp3	i observed this also
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1969.mp3	when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1970.mp3	and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1971.mp3	and the nuts and roots much improved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1972.mp3	when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1973.mp3	and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1974.mp3	i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1975.mp3	the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1976.mp3	this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1977.mp3	his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1978.mp3	after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overcome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1979.mp3	i lay down among some straw and fell asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1980.mp3	which shone brightly on the white ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1981.mp3	i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1982.mp3	allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1983.mp3	refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1984.mp3	no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1985.mp3	however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1986.mp3	that i might view the adjacent cottage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1987.mp3	one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1988.mp3	all the light i enjoyed came through the sty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1989.mp3	having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1990.mp3	by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1991.mp3	which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1992.mp3	the rain dropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1993.mp3	with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1994.mp3	her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1995.mp3	and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1996.mp3	presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1997.mp3	on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1998.mp3	whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/1999.mp3	who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2000.mp3	the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2001.mp3	he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2002.mp3	and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2003.mp3	bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2004.mp3	and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2005.mp3	and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2006.mp3	the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2007.mp3	the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2008.mp3	but to my extreme wonder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2009.mp3	did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2010.mp3	the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2011.mp3	i now hasten to the more moving part of my story i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been have made me what i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2012.mp3	it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2013.mp3	my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labour the old man played on his guitar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2014.mp3	that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2015.mp3	that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a country man as a guide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2016.mp3	the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2017.mp3	on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2018.mp3	and her complexion wondrously fair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2019.mp3	every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2020.mp3	she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2021.mp3	she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2022.mp3	and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2023.mp3	she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2024.mp3	and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2025.mp3	presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2026.mp3	retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2027.mp3	was the subject of their conversation i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible the next morning felix went out to his work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2028.mp3	and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2029.mp3	when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2030.mp3	the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2031.mp3	the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2032.mp3	in the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2033.mp3	in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2034.mp3	although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2035.mp3	my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2036.mp3	who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2037.mp3	the book from which felix instructed safie was volney's ruins of empires i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2038.mp3	he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2039.mp3	and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2040.mp3	degenerating of the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2041.mp3	inhabitants these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2042.mp3	and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2043.mp3	a condition more abject than that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2044.mp3	or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2045.mp3	i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2046.mp3	united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2047.mp3	and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2048.mp3	sensations of hunger thirst and heat of what a strange nature is knowledge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2049.mp3	and that was death a state which i feared yet did not understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2050.mp3	except through means which i obtained by stealth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2051.mp3	miserable unhappy wretch other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2052.mp3	how the father doted on the smiles of the infant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2053.mp3	no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2054.mp3	all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2055.mp3	i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2056.mp3	a bully boat and a brag captain a story of steamboat life on the mississippi by sol smith does any one remember the caravan she was what would now be considered a slow boat then eighteen twenty seven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2057.mp3	she was regularly advertised as the fast running et cetera her regular trips from new orleans to natchez were usually made in from six to eight days a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2058.mp3	a voyage from new orleans to vicksburg and back including stoppages generally entitled the officers and crew to a month's wages whether the caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the falls louisville i have never learned if she did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2059.mp3	she must have had a time of it it was my fate to take passage in this boat the captain was a good natured easy going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of brag we had been out a little more than five days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2060.mp3	and we were in hopes of seeing the bluffs of natchez on the next day our wood was getting low and night coming on the pilot on duty above the other pilot held three aces at the time and was just calling out the captain who went it strong on three kings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2061.mp3	sent down word that the mate had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the two passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2062.mp3	which he said was situated right round yonder point but muttered the captain i don't much like to take wood of the yellow faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than any one else however there's no other chance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2063.mp3	and in a little less than an hour when our fuel was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good sized wood pile hallo colonel how d'ye sell your wood this time a yellow faced old gentleman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2064.mp3	with a two weeks beard strings over his shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of copperas colored linsey woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee shoes without stockings a faded broad brimmed hat which had once been black

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2066.mp3	what's the odd quarter for i should like to know you only charged me three as i went down why captaing drawled out the wood merchant with a sort of leer on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2067.mp3	wood's riz since you went down two weeks ago besides you are awar that you very seldom stop going down

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2069.mp3	in about half an hour we felt the caravan commence paddling again supper was over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2070.mp3	situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2071.mp3	how does that wood burn inquired the captain of the mate who was looking on at the game tisn't of much account i reckon answered the mate it's cottonwood and most of it green at that well thompson three aces again stranger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2072.mp3	thompson i say we'd better take three or four cords at the next woodyard it can't be more than six miles from here two aces and a bragger with the age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2073.mp3	the game went on and the paddles kept moving at eleven o'clock it was reported to the captain that we were nearing the woodyard the light being distinctly seen by the pilot on duty head her in shore then and take in six cords if it's good see to it thompson
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2074.mp3	i can't very well leave the game now it's getting right warm this pilot's beating us all to smash the wooding completed we paddled on again the captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodyard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2075.mp3	three and a quarter but soon again became interested in the game from my upper berth there were no state rooms then i could observe the movements of the players
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2076.mp3	the latter personages took it turn and turn about steering and playing brag one of them almost invariably winning while the two passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing cutting and paying up their anties they were anxious to learn the game
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2077.mp3	and they did learn it once in a while indeed seeing they had two aces and a bragger they would venture a bet of five or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the captain or pilot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2078.mp3	or if they did venture to call out on two bullits and a bragger they had the mortification to find one of the officers had the same kind of a hand and were more venerable still with all these disadvantages they continued playing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2079.mp3	they wanted to learn the game at two o'clock the captain asked the mate how we were getting on oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2080.mp3	this wood seems rather better than that we took in at yellow face's but we're nearly out again and must be looking out for more i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail yes yes replied the captain ring the bell and ask em what's the price of wood up here i've got you again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2081.mp3	i heard the bell and the pilot's hail what's your price for wood a youthful voice on the shore answered three and a quarter d net ejaculated the captain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2082.mp3	the strangers suffering some at the same time three and a quarter again are we never to get to a cheaper country deal sir if you please better luck next time the other pilot's voice was again heard on deck how much have you only about ten cords sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2083.mp3	was the reply of the youthful salesman the captain here told thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game the pilots here changed places when did they sleep wood taken in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2084.mp3	the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length dawned the brag party broke up and settlements were being made during which operation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2085.mp3	the captain's bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat which by his reckoning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2086.mp3	it appears the two passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost one hundred and twenty dollars the captain as he rose to see about taking in some good wood which he felt sure of obtaining now that he had got above the level country winked at his opponent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2087.mp3	the pilot with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game and said in an undertone forty apiece for you and i and james the other pilot is not bad for one night i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2088.mp3	there was just fog enough to prevent the vision taking in more than sixty yards so i was disappointed in my expectation we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood the banks being invisible from the middle of the river there it is exclaimed the captain stop her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2089.mp3	and the captain hailed hallo the woodyard hallo yourself answered a squeaking female voice which came from a woman with a petticoat over her shoulders in place of a shawl what's the price of wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2090.mp3	i think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petticoat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2091.mp3	and now you know it three and the d l broke in the captain what have you raised on your wood too i'll give you three and not a cent more well replied the petticoat here comes the old man he'll talk to you and sure enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2092.mp3	out crept from the cottage the veritable faded hat copperas colored pants yellow countenance and two weeks beard we had seen the night before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2093.mp3	accompanied by the same leer of the same yellow countenance why darn it all capting there is but three or four cords left and since it's you i don't care if i do let you have it for three as you're a good customer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2094.mp3	and turned in to take some rest the fact became apparent the reader will probably have discovered it some time since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2095.mp3	the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2096.mp3	proof all the modes in which any given body is affected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2097.mp3	wherefore their idea also necessarily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2098.mp3	therefore the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies involves the nature of the human body and of the external body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2099.mp3	hence it follows first that the human mind perceives the nature of a variety of bodies together with the nature of its own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2100.mp3	it will have the idea of the mode as actually existing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2101.mp3	in other words it will have the idea which does not exclude but postulates the existence or presence of the nature of the external body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2102.mp3	will regard the external body as actually existing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2103.mp3	corollary the mind is able to regard as present external bodies by which the human body has once been affected even though they be no longer in existence or present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2104.mp3	by which the human body has once been affected be no longer in existence the mind will nevertheless regard them as present as often as this action of the body is repeated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2105.mp3	note we thus see how it comes about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2106.mp3	the latter indicates rather the disposition of paul's body than the nature of peter and therefore while this disposition of paul's body lasts paul's mind will regard peter as present to itself even though he no longer exists further to retain the usual phraseology
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2107.mp3	the modifications of the human body of which the ideas represent external bodies as present to us we will call the images of things though they do not recall the figure of things when the mind regards bodies in this fashion we say that it imagines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2108.mp3	looked at in themselves do not contain error the mind does not err in the mere act of imagining but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2109.mp3	which association arises in the mind according to the order and association of the modifications affectiones of the human body i say first it is an association of those ideas only
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2110.mp3	ideas of the modifications of the human body are strictly speaking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2111.mp3	those which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies i say secondly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2112.mp3	in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2113.mp3	whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2114.mp3	and hence we can further clearly understand why the mind from the thought of one thing should straightway arrive at the thought of another thing which has no similarity with the first for instance from the thought of the word pomum an apple
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2115.mp3	a roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question nor anything in common with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2116.mp3	that is that the man has often heard the word pomum while he was looking at the fruit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2117.mp3	or the human mind perceives those modifications
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2118.mp3	the human body itself and as actually existing therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2119.mp3	following in god in the same manner and being referred to god in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the human body proof

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2187.mp3	restored florina's health and gave her strength to call a council and arrange all the affairs of her kingdom then she departed by night and alone to go over the world in search of her blue bird the magician
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2188.mp3	who was king charming's friend went to the fairy soussio whom he knew for they had quarrelled and made it up again as fairies and magicians do many times within the last five or six hundred years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2189.mp3	she received him civilly and asked him what he wanted he tried to make a bargain with her but could effect nothing unless king charming would consent to marry troutina the enchanter found this bride so ugly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2190.mp3	that he could not advise still the blue bird had run so many risks in his cage the nail it was hung upon had broken and the king suffered much in the fall minetta the cat had glowered at him with her green eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2191.mp3	he had been a linnet or a jay worse than all his next heir spread reports of his death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2192.mp3	under these circumstances the magician thought it best to agree with soussio that king charming should be restored to his kingdom and his natural shape for six months on condition that troutina should remain in his palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2193.mp3	but he thought less of these things than how to escape from the horror of marrying troutina meanwhile the queen florina in a peasant's dress with a straw hat on her head and a canvas sack on her shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2194.mp3	what are you doing here all alone good mother replied the queen i have too many troubles to be pleasant company for anybody tell me your troubles and i may be able to soften them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2195.mp3	do not afflict yourself happiness will yet be yours take these four eggs and whenever you are in trouble break them and see what ensues so saying the fairy vanished florina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2196.mp3	greatly comforted put the eggs in her sack
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2197.mp3	she walked eight days and nights without stopping and then came to a mountain made entirely of ivory and nearly perpendicular despairing of ever climbing it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2198.mp3	she sank down at the foot prepared to die there when she bethought herself of the eggs let me see said she if the fairy has deceived me or not so she broke one and inside it were little hooks of gold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2199.mp3	which she fitted on her feet and hands and by means of which she climbed the mountain with ease arrived at the summit she found new difficulties for the valley below was one large smooth mirror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2200.mp3	in which sixty thousand women stood admiring themselves they had need for the charm of the mirror was that each saw herself therein not as she was but as she wished to be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2201.mp3	and the grimaces they made were enough to cause a person to die of laughter not one of them had ever gained the top of the mountain and when they saw florina there they all burst into angry outcries
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2202.mp3	will you convey me to the palace of king charming the obedient pigeons did so flying day and night till they reached the city gates when the queen dismissed them with a sweet kiss which was worth more than her crown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2203.mp3	besides he is going to morrow to the temple with the princess troutina whom he has at last agreed to marry florina sat down on a door step and hid her face under her straw hat and her drooping hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2204.mp3	alas she cried my blue bird has forsaken me she neither ate nor slept but rose with the dawn and pushed her way through the guards to the temple where she saw two thrones one for king charming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2205.mp3	and the other for troutina they arrived shortly he more charming and she more repulsive than ever knitting her brows troutina exclaimed what creature is that who dares approach so near my golden throne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2206.mp3	these are pretty trinkets said troutina and going up to the king she asked him what he thought of them at sight of the ornaments he turned pale remembering those he had given to florina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2207.mp3	these bracelets are worth half my kingdom i did not think there had been more than one pair in the world then i will buy these said troutina but florina refused to sell them for money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2208.mp3	the price she asked was permission to sleep a night in the chamber of echoes as you will your bargains are cheap enough replied troutina laughing and when she laughed she showed teeth like the tusks of a wild boar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2209.mp3	now the king when he was a blue bird had informed florina about this chamber of echoes where every word spoken could be heard in his own chamber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2210.mp3	but she had no more jewels to tempt troutina so she broke the third egg out of it came a chariot of polished steel inlaid with gold drawn by six green mice the coachman being a rose coloured rat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2211.mp3	and the postilion a grey one inside the carriage sat little puppets who behaved themselves just like live ladies and gentlemen when troutina went to walk in the palace garden florina awaited her in a green alley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2212.mp3	and made the mice gallop and the ladies and gentlemen bow till the princess was delighted and ready to buy the curiosity at any price again florina exacted permission to pass the night in the chamber of echoes and again the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2213.mp3	undisturbed by her lamentation slept without waking till dawn the third day one of the palace valets passing her by said you stupid peasant girl it is well the king takes opium every night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2214.mp3	or you would disturb him by that terrible sobbing of yours does he so said the queen now comprehending all then if you will promise to night to keep the opium cup out of his way these pearls and diamonds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2215.mp3	and she took a handful of them from her sack shall assuredly be yours the valet promised and then florina broke her fourth egg out of which came a pie composed of birds which though they had been plucked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2216.mp3	baked and made ready for the table sang as beautifully as birds that are alive troutina charmed with this marvellous novelty bought it at the same price as the rest adding generously a small piece of gold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2217.mp3	then he rose up dressed himself hastily and went in search of her she was sitting mournfully on the floor with her hair hiding her face and her eyes swollen with tears but he knew at once his faithful florina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2218.mp3	and they embraced and wept together for what was the good of all their love when they were still in the power of the fairy soussio but at this moment appeared the friendly enchanter with a fairy still greater than soussio
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2219.mp3	the one who had given florina the four eggs they declared that their united power was stronger than soussio's and that the lovers should be married without further delay when this news reached troutina she ran to the chamber of echoes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2220.mp3	and there beheld her beautiful rival whom she had so cruelly afflicted but the moment she opened her mouth to speak her wicked tongue was silenced for ever for the magician turned her into a trout which he flung out of the window
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2221.mp3	this family likeness may be traced in the fairy tales of all countries i merely refer to it to show that the repetition of incidents was not unobserved or unintentional
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2222.mp3	where he spent his time in knocking his head against the wall until the courtiers were afraid he would kill himself they accordingly placed stuffed mattresses over every wall and allowed all his subjects who desired
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2223.mp3	covered from head to foot in a long crape veil who wept and sobbed so much that the king noticed her she told him that she did not come like the rest to console him but rather to encourage his grief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2224.mp3	she herself had lost the best of husbands and here she began to weep so profusely that it was a wonder her eyes were not melted out of her head the king began to weep in company and to talk to her of his dear wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2225.mp3	she did the same of her dear husband in fact they talked so much that they talked their sorrow quite away then lifting up her veil she showed lovely blue eyes and dark eyelashes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2226.mp3	the king noticed her more and more he spoke less and less of the departed queen by and by he ceased to speak of her at all the end was that he courted the inconsolable lady in the black veil and married her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2227.mp3	by his first marriage he had one daughter called florina or the little flora because she was so fresh and lovely at the time of his second marriage she was quite fifteen years old the new queen also had a daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2228.mp3	who was being brought up by her godmother the fairy soussio her name was troutina because her complexion was all spotted like a trout's back indeed she was altogether ugly and disagreeable and when contrasted with florina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2229.mp3	the king disputed nothing indeed he never did the queen ruled him in all things some time after news came that king charming would shortly arrive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2230.mp3	when the queen heard this news she sent for milliners dressmakers jewellers and decked troutina from head to foot but to florina she allowed not a single new frock the poor princess had to put on her old one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2231.mp3	who presented to him troutina all blazing with jewels yet so ugly that king charming involuntarily turned away his eyes but madam is there not another princess called florina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2232.mp3	he rose and made her a profound reverence paying her besides so many elegant compliments that the queen became very much displeased king charming took no heed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2233.mp3	but conversed with florina for three hours without stopping indeed his admiration of her was so plain that the queen and troutina begged of the king that she might be shut up in a tower during the whole time of his visit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2234.mp3	four men in masks entered and carried her off leaving her in a dark cell and in the utmost desolation meantime king charming eagerly awaited her re appearance but he saw her no more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2235.mp3	and by the queen's orders every one about him spoke all the evil they could of poor florina but he refused to believe one word no said he nature could not have united a base nature to such a sweet innocent face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2236.mp3	florina shut up in her tower lamented bitterly ah would i had been sent here before i saw this amiable prince who was so kind to me it is to prevent my meeting him again that the queen treats me so cruelly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2237.mp3	alas the little beauty i have has cost me sore the queen to win king charming for her daughter made him many presents among the rest an order of knighthood a golden heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2238.mp3	but pierced by one only the motto being she alone the heart was made of a single ruby as big as an ostrich's egg
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2239.mp3	a finger's length and the chain was of pearls each weighing a pound when the young king received this very handsome present he was much perplexed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2240.mp3	as i cannot fulfil it to troutina i would rather decline the favour she offers me than become unworthy of it civil as this answer was it irritated the queen and her daughter exceedingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2241.mp3	and when since in all his audiences with their majesties he never saw florina he at last inquired where the younger princess was the queen answered fiercely that she was shut up in prison and would remain there till troutina was married
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2242.mp3	when he was alone he sent for one of his attendants whom he trusted very much and begged him to gain information from some court lady about the princess florina this scheme succeeded so well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2243.mp3	next night troutina thickly veiled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2244.mp3	king charming met her received her in his arms and vowed to love her for ever then he lifted her into the fairy chariot and they sailed about in the air for some hours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2245.mp3	but as he was not likely to wish to sail about for ever he at last proposed that they should descend to earth and be married troutina agreed with all her heart but wished that the ceremony should be performed at her godmother's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2246.mp3	my child replied the godmother that is more easily said than done he is too deeply in love with florina meantime the king was left waiting in a chamber with diamond walls so thin and transparent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2247.mp3	that through them he saw troutina and soussio conversing together he stood like a man in a dream what am i betrayed has this enemy to my peace carried away my dear florina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2248.mp3	how great was his despair when soussio said to him in a commanding voice king charming behold the princess troutina to whom you have promised your faith marry her immediately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2249.mp3	do you think me a fool cried the king i have promised her nothing she is stop if you show me any disrespect i will respect you as much as a fairy deserves to be respected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2250.mp3	if you will only give me back my princess am not i she said troutina it was to me you gave this ring to me you spoke at the window i have been wickedly deceived cried the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2251.mp3	but i will love no one except florina soussio employed persuasions threats promises entreaties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2252.mp3	and then tried quiet sulkiness but the king uttered not a word for twenty days and twenty nights he stood there without sleeping or eating or once sitting down they talking all the while at length soussio
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2253.mp3	quite worn out said choose seven years of penitence and punishment or marry my goddaughter i choose answered the king and i will not marry your goddaughter then fly out of this window in the shape of a blue bird
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2254.mp3	immediately the king's figure changed his arms formed themselves into wings his legs and feet turned black and thin and claws grew upon them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2255.mp3	his body wasted into the slender shape of a bird and was covered with bright blue feathers his eyes became round and beady his nose an ivory beak and his crown was a white plume on the top of his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2256.mp3	he began to speak in a singing voice and then uttering a doleful cry fled away as far as possible from the fatal palace of soussio but though he looked only a blue bird
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2257.mp3	the king was his own natural self still and remembered all his misfortunes and did not cease to lament for his beautiful florina flying from tree to tree he sang melancholy songs about her and himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2258.mp3	and wished he were dead many a time the fairy soussio sent back troutina to her mother who was furious florina shall repent having pleased king charming cried she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2259.mp3	and dressing her own daughter in rich garments with a gold crown on her head and king charming's ring on her finger she took her to the tower florina your sister is come to see and bring you marriage presents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2260.mp3	for she is now the wife of king charming florina doubting no more her lover's loss fell down in a swoon and the queen immediately went to tell her father that she was mad for love and must be watched closely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2261.mp3	lest she should in some way disgrace herself the king said her stepmother might do with her exactly what she pleased when the princess recovered from her swoon she began to weep and wept all night long
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2262.mp3	but it was too dark to see who she was and at daylight she shut the window next night it was broad moonlight and then he saw clearly the figure of a young girl weeping sore and knew that it was his beloved florina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2263.mp3	when she paused in her lamentations adorable princess said he why do you mourn your troubles are not without remedy who speaks to me so gently asked she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2264.mp3	a king who loves you and will never love any other so saying he flew up to the window and at first frightened the princess very much for she could not understand such an extraordinary thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2265.mp3	as a bird who talked in words like a man yet kept still the piping voice of a nightingale but soon she began stroking his beautiful plumage and caressing him who are you charming bird
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2266.mp3	you have spoken my name i am king charming condemned to be a bird for seven years because i will not renounce you ah do not deceive me i know you have married troutina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2267.mp3	sang the blue bird and told her his whole story which comforted her so much that she thought no more of her misfortunes they conversed till daybreak and promised faithfully every night to meet again thus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2268.mp3	what should i do if i saw his poor feathers scattered on the ground and knew that he was no more so she grieved all day long the beautiful blue bird hid in a hollow tree spent the hours in thinking of his princess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2269.mp3	and sought for some diamond ear rings which he brought back in his beak and when night came offered them to florina so night after night he brought her something beautiful and they talked together till day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2270.mp3	where he sang her praises in a voice so sweet that the passers by thought it was not a bird but a spirit rumours went about that the place was haunted and no one would go near the spot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2271.mp3	and though she saw nobody and he lived in the hollow of a tree they always found plenty to say to one another the malicious queen tried with all her might to get troutina married but in vain nobody would have her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2272.mp3	if it were florina now said the kings or the kings ambassadors we should be most happy to sign the contract that girl thwarts us still said the queen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2273.mp3	who liked to see her lovely and she had adorned herself with all the pretty things he had given her he perched on the window sill and she sat at the window and they were singing together a duet which the queen heard outside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2274.mp3	stood in his doorway in the clear sunshine of this lovely summer morning both hands plunged deep into his pockets as was his wont and looked about him as if to see whether everything in the outer world was the same as yesterday
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2275.mp3	and stuffed his hands deeper into his pockets it's always so with me said judith when i've lost anything i can't see it oh ho you're making a fool of me again that's all the thanks i get for telling you that you are losing something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2276.mp3	and i was just going to make you a present that is worth more than five francs to a fellow like you what is it show it to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2277.mp3	first i will tell you something and then you shall have it replied judith look here blasi my sainted father used to say if you keep your hands out of your pockets they will get full but if you keep them in your pockets will be empty now both your hands are in your pockets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2278.mp3	no one ever knows how to take you grumbled blasi it wouldn't help you to take me if you did not take your hands out too said judith but never mind i have really something good for you and judith motioned to him to come nearer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2279.mp3	would you like to have a nice well washed shirt for sunday i will do one up for you if you will tell me something that was an offer worth listening to sunday was a wretched day for blasi for when he had turned his two shirts and worn them both on both sides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2280.mp3	he had never a clean one for sunday he had no one to wash for him his mother was dead and his father had enough else to spend for without the washing for a grown up son blasi's money went for other things than washing and he was not fond of doing it for himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2281.mp3	come a little nearer to the well no one knows who may be behind those trees now listen can you tell me what is going wrong with dietrich he never whistles now he never laughs and his mother looks so sad and she rarely speaks even to answer when spoken to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2282.mp3	something has happened to dietrich yes and keeps on happening all sorts of things too but jost can tell you more than i can they sit together in the rehbock half the night and more too long after everybody else has gone there they sit in the little back room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2283.mp3	i don't understand anything about it somebody comes over from fohrensee and explains it to them he does not belong there but i guess you have seen him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2284.mp3	he has fiery red hair and red beard and red face he has business in fohrensee once a week and lives the rest of the time down in the city and he arranges everything down there and then brings the account of gains and losses up to them but it's a good deal more loss than gain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2285.mp3	dietrich puts in more money every time jost has nothing to put in but promises he tells dietrich all the time that presently the winnings will begin to flow in and says that at first a fellow must expect to lose so as to win all the more in the end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2286.mp3	i am just waiting though till i can trip him up and i'll do it with a vengeance too so that he won't forget it all his life long now that is a good idea said judith you'd better tell him then that you do it to pay your debts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2287.mp3	do you think she will have him the question seemed to interest judith for she stood stock still who whom what do you mean i mean veronica and jost do you think she will take him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2288.mp3	as blasi spoke he came slowly nearer to judith he has been saying some things lately that made me think so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2289.mp3	i know what you mean he went on but i am not so very stupid as you think it certainly means something when she is so changed jost says that she knows all that dietrich has been about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2290.mp3	and she is hot with anger against him because he has not told her about it himself jost says that if he only mentions dietrich's name before her she looks like a wild cat in a moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2291.mp3	and he says too that he has noticed for some time that she has no objection to letting dietrich see that she can get along very well without his help and you know that she is capable of anything when she's angry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2292.mp3	and muttered i wonder if she wants to get him too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2293.mp3	yes she is she is she is capable of anything when she is angry now judith had looked upon her neighbor's boy from his childhood up as if he belonged to her he was her prime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2294.mp3	this very reserve however was rather distasteful to judith as regarded herself but she liked it towards others she had planned it all out that dietrich should marry veronica soon after the confirmation that they should set up a pretty little establishment and be her beloved neighbors

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2404.mp3	all built of white marble with a fountain in front and peacocks strutting about on the lawn well the fiddler smoothed down his hair and brushed his clothes a bit and off he went to see what was to be seen at the grand house at the end of the garden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2405.mp3	he entered the door and nobody said no to him then he passed through one room after another and each was finer than the one he left behind many servants stood around but they only bowed and never asked whence he came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2406.mp3	the table was spread with a feast that smelled so good that it brought tears to the fiddler's eyes and water to his mouth and all the plates were of pure gold the little old man sat alone but another place was spread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2407.mp3	do not say that sit down to the table and eat and when i have told you all you will say it was not ill luck but good luck that brought you the fiddler had his own mind about that but all the same down he sat at the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2408.mp3	and fell to with knife and fork at the good things as though he had not had a bite to eat for a week of sundays i am the richest man in the world says the little old man after a while i am glad to hear it says the fiddler you may well be said the old man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2409.mp3	and without wife or child and this morning i said to myself that the first body that came to my house i would take for a son or a daughter as the case might be you are the first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2410.mp3	and so you shall live with me as long as i live and after i am gone everything that i have shall be yours the fiddler did nothing but stare with open eyes and mouth as though he would never shut either again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2411.mp3	everything the fiddler wanted came to his hand he lived high and slept soft and warm and never knew what it was to want either more or less or great or small in all of those three or four days he did nothing but enjoy himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2412.mp3	with might and main but by and by he began to wonder where all the good things came from then before long he fell to pestering the old man with questions about the matter at first the old man put him off with short answers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2413.mp3	but the fiddler was a master hand at finding out anything he wanted to know he dinned and drummed and worried until flesh and blood could stand it no longer so at last the old man said that he would show him the treasure house where all his wealth came from
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2414.mp3	and at that the fiddler was tickled beyond measure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2415.mp3	there in a corner by the wall was a great trap door of iron the old man fitted the key to the lock and turned it he lifted the door and then went down a steep flight of stone steps and the fiddler followed close at his heels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2416.mp3	down below it was as light as day for in the centre of the room hung a great lamp that shone with a bright light
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2417.mp3	you must never open that door yonder at the back of the room should you do so ill luck will be sure to overtake you oh no the fiddler would never think of doing such a thing as opening the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2418.mp3	and out into the sunlight again it took him maybe an hour to count all the money and jewels he had brought up with him after he had done that he began to wonder what was inside of the little door at the back of the room first he wondered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2419.mp3	perhaps i can see what is there without opening the door so down he took the key and off he marched to the garden he opened the trap door and went down the steep steps to the room below there was the door at the end of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2420.mp3	but when he came to look there was no key hole to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2421.mp3	he heard a sound like the waves beating on the shore well says he this is the most curious thing i have seen for a long time since i have come so far i may as well see the end of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2422.mp3	so he entered the passageway and closed the door behind him he went on and on and the spark of light kept growing larger and larger and by and by pop out he came at the other end of the passage sure enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2423.mp3	there he stood on the sea shore with the waves beating and dashing on the rocks he stood looking and wondering to find himself in such a place when all of a sudden something came with a whiz and a rush and caught him by the belt and away he flew like a bullet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2424.mp3	by and by he managed to screw his head around and look up and there it was ill luck that had him i thought so said the fiddler and then he gave over kicking well on and on they flew over hill and valley over moor and mountain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2425.mp3	until they came to another garden and there ill luck let the fiddler drop swash down he fell into the top of an apple tree and there he hung in the branches it was the garden of a royal castle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2426.mp3	and all had been weeping and woe though they were beginning now to pick up their smiles again and this was the reason why the king of that country had died and no one was left behind him but the queen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2427.mp3	and so she had come out into the garden for a bit of rest and there she sat under the shade of an apple tree fanning herself and crying when swash down fell the fiddler into the apple tree and down fell a dozen apples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2428.mp3	you fell from heaven for i saw it with my eyes and heard it with my ears i see how it is now you were sent hither from heaven to be my husband and my husband you shall be you shall be king of this country half and half with me as queen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2429.mp3	and shall sit on a throne beside me you can guess whether or not that was music to the fiddler's ears so the princes were sent packing and the fiddler was married to the queen and reigned in that country well three or four days passed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2430.mp3	and all was as sweet and happy as a spring day but at the end of that time the fiddler began to wonder what was to be seen in the castle the queen was very fond of him and was glad enough to show him all the fine things that were to be seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2431.mp3	you must not ask or wish to know should you open that door ill luck will be sure to overtake you pooh said the fiddler i don't care to know anyhow and off they went hand in hand yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2432.mp3	that was a very fine thing to say but before an hour had gone by the fiddler's head began to hum and buzz like a beehive i don't believe said he there would be a grain of harm in my peeping inside that door all the same
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2433.mp3	why look says he it is just like the door at the rich man's house over yonder i wonder if it is the same inside as outside and he opened the door and peeped in yes there was the long passage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2434.mp3	and the spark of light at the far end as though the sun were shining he cocked his head to one side and listened yes said he i think i hear the water rushing but i am not sure i will just go a little further in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2435.mp3	and listen and so he entered and closed the door behind him well he went on and on until pop there he was out at the farther end and before he knew what he was about he had stepped out upon the sea shore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2436.mp3	away flew the fiddler like a bullet and there was ill luck carrying him by the belt again away they sped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2437.mp3	until the fiddler's head grew so dizzy that he had to shut his eyes suddenly ill luck let him drop and down he fell thump bump on the hard ground then he opened his eyes and sat up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2438.mp3	or else i would have been a king if it had not been for ill luck and that is the way we all of us talk doctor faustus had sat all the while neither drinking ale nor smoking tobacco but with his hands folded and in silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2439.mp3	i know not why it is said he but that story of yours my friend brings to my mind a story of a man whom i once knew a great magician in his time and a necromancer and a chemist and an alchemist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2440.mp3	and a rhetorician an astronomer an astrologer and a philosopher as well tis a long list of excellency said old bidpai
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2441.mp3	nay said saint george everything must have a name it hath no name said doctor faustus but i shall give it a name and it shall be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2442.mp3	once upon a time there was a servant who served a wise man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2443.mp3	day after day time in and time out for seven years in those years the servant was well enough contented but no one likes to abide in the same place forever and so one day he took it into his head that he would like to go out into the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2444.mp3	to see what kind of a fortune a man might make there for himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2445.mp3	you have served me faithfully these seven years gone and now that you ask leave to go you shall go but it is little or nothing in the way of money that i can give you and so you will have to be content with what i can afford
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2446.mp3	see here is a little pebble and its like is not to be found in the seven kingdoms for whoever holds it in his mouth can hear while he does so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2447.mp3	paying his way with the few pennies he had saved in his seven years of service but for all of his travelling nothing of good happened to him until one morning he came to a lonely place where there stood a gallows and there he sat him down to rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2448.mp3	and it is just in such an unlikely place as this that a man's best chance of fortune comes to him sometimes as the servant sat there there came two ravens flying and lit upon the cross beam overhead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2449.mp3	there they began talking to one another and the servant popped the pebble into his mouth to hear what they might say yonder is a traveller in the world said the first raven yes said the second
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2450.mp3	why thus said the second
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2451.mp3	and there he would find a man sitting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2452.mp3	that man would lead him to the garden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2453.mp3	the fruit of happiness said the first raven and of what use would the fruit of happiness be to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2454.mp3	and wish and whatever one asks for one shall have you may guess that when the servant understood the talk of the ravens he was not slow in making use of what he heard up he scrambled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2455.mp3	and away he went as fast as his legs could carry him on and on he travelled until he came to the cross roads and the stone cross of which the raven spoke and there sure enough sat the traveller
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2456.mp3	there is one condition you must fulfil many strange things will happen upon our journey between here and there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2457.mp3	and say not a word do you agree to that yes said the servant i do very well said his new comrade then let us be jogging
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2458.mp3	and the time is none too long to get there so all the rest of that day they journeyed onward together until towards evening they came to a town with high towers and steep roofs and tall spires
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2459.mp3	the servant's companion entered the gate as though he knew the place right well and led the way up one street and down another until by and by they came to a noble house that stood a little apart by itself with gardens of flowers and fruit trees all around it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2460.mp3	there the travelling companion stopped and drawing out a little pipe from under his jacket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2461.mp3	to listen to the music well he played and played until by and by the door opened and out came a serving man ho piper said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2462.mp3	where dozens of servants were serving a fine feast but only one man sat at table a young man with a face so sorrowful that it made a body's heart ache to look upon him can you play good music piper said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2463.mp3	but suddenly everything went wrong his wife and he fell out and quarrelled until there was no living together and she had to go back to her old home then his companions deserted him and now he lived all alone yours is a hard case said the travelling companion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2464.mp3	thereupon he drew out his pipes and began to play and it was such a tune as no man ever listened to before he played and he played and after a while one after another of those who listened to him began to get drowsy first they winked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2465.mp3	then they shut their eyes and then they nodded until all were as dumb as logs and as sound asleep as though they would never waken again only the servant and the piper stayed awake for the music did not make them drowsy as it did the rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2466.mp3	then when all but they two were tight and fast asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2467.mp3	and stepping up to the young man took from off his finger a splendid ruby ring as red as blood and as bright as fire and popped the same into his pocket and all the while the serving man stood gaping like a fish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2468.mp3	to see what his comrade was about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2469.mp3	none was more ugly than this to bewitch the poor sorrowful young man into a sleep and then to rob him of his ruby ring
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2470.mp3	but the next day they jogged on together again until by and by they came to a great forest there they wandered up and down till night came upon them and found them still stumbling onward through the darkness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2471.mp3	he seemed to doubt nothing nor fear nothing but trudged straight ahead until by and by they saw a light twinkling far away and when they came to it they found a gloomy stone house as ugly as eyes ever looked upon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2472.mp3	up stepped the servant's comrade and knocked upon the door rap tap tap by and by it was opened a crack and there stood an ugly old woman blear eyed and crooked and gnarled as a winter twig
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2473.mp3	no matter for that said the travelling companion we can go no farther to night so you must let us in and hide us as best you may and in he went as he said with the servant at his heels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2474.mp3	trembling like a leaf at what he had heard the old woman gave them some bread and meat to eat and then hid them away in the great empty meal chest in the corner and there they lay as still as mice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2475.mp3	by and by in came the gang of thieves with a great noise and uproar and down they sat to their supper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2476.mp3	how they had cruelly robbed and murdered poor people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2477.mp3	he drew from his pocket the ruby ring which he had stolen from the sorrowful young man's finger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2478.mp3	then he led the way out of the house and if the serving man had wondered the day before at that which the comrade did he wondered ten times more to see him give so beautiful a ring
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2479.mp3	the two travellers came to a little hut neat enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2480.mp3	and there the comrade knocked upon the door and asked for lodging
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2481.mp3	nevertheless they made the travellers welcome and set before them the very best that was to be had in the house and after both had eaten and drunk they showed them to bed in a corner as clean as snow and there they slept the night through
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2482.mp3	but the next morning before the dawning of the day the travelling companion was stirring again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2483.mp3	for i have a bit of work to do before i leave this place and strange work it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2484.mp3	he gathered together a great heap of straw and sticks of wood and stuffed all under the corner of the house then he struck a light and set fire to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2485.mp3	all was a red blaze behind them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2486.mp3	on they jogged and by the time evening was at hand they had come to a neat cottage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2487.mp3	in this cottage lived a widow and her only son and they also made the travellers welcome and set before them a good supper and showed them to a clean bed this time the travelling comrade did neither good nor ill to those of the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2488.mp3	but in the morning he told the widow whither they were going and asked if she and her son knew the way to the garden where grew the fruit of happiness yes said she that we do for the garden is not a day's journey from here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2489.mp3	and my son himself shall go with you to show you the way that is good said the servant's comrade and if he will do so i will pay him well for his trouble so the young man put on his hat and took up his stick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2490.mp3	and off went the three up hill and down dale until by and by they came over the top of the last hill and there below them lay the garden and what a sight it was the leaves shining and glistening like so many jewels in the sunlight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2491.mp3	all he could do was to stand and look
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2492.mp3	torrent without a bridge for a body to cross over yonder is what you seek said the young man pointing with his finger and there you can see for yourself the fruit of happiness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2493.mp3	but suddenly catching the widow's son by the collar he lifted him and flung him into the black rushing water splash went the young man and then away he went whirling over rocks and water falls there cried the comrade
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2494.mp3	that is your reward for your service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2495.mp3	he found his tongue at last and all that he had bottled up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2496.mp3	such abuse as he showered upon his travelling companion no man ever listened to before but to all the servant said the other answered never a word until he had stopped for sheer want of breath then poor fool said the travelling companion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2497.mp3	thereupon as he ended speaking he struck his staff upon the ground instantly the earth trembled and the sky darkened overhead until it grew as black as night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2498.mp3	the garden and the torrent and all were gone and nothing was left but a naked plain covered over with the bones of those who had come that way before seeking the fruit which the travelling servant had sought it was a long time before the servant found his way back into the world again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2499.mp3	but what a change he beheld it was a poor cottage no longer but a splendid palace fit for a queen to dwell in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2500.mp3	and she was dressed in clothes fit for a queen to wear shining with gold and silver and precious stones the servant stood and stared like one bereft of wits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2501.mp3	an angel came and showed the way to my son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2502.mp3	but to bring an apple for me also then the poor travelling servant began to thump his head he saw well enough through the millstone now and that he too might have had one of the fruit if he had but held his tongue a little longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2503.mp3	the house that he had seen the angel set fire to there he beheld masons and carpenters hard at work hacking and hewing and building a fine new house and there he saw the poor man himself standing by giving them orders how is this said the travelling servant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2504.mp3	for many a long day and never knew that a great treasure of silver and gold was hidden beneath it until a few days ago there came an angel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2505.mp3	the next morning the poor servant jogged along on his homeward way more sad and downcast than ever and by evening he had come to the robbers den in the thick woods and there the old woman came running to the door to meet him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2506.mp3	he gave it to the captain of the band and after he had gone the robbers fought for it with one another until they were all killed so now the world is rid of them and travellers can come and go as they please back jogged the travelling servant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2507.mp3	and the next day came to the town and to the house of the sorrowful young man there lo and behold instead of being dark and silent as it was before all was ablaze with light and noisy with the sound of rejoicing and merriment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2508.mp3	there happened to be one of the household standing at the door and he knew the servant as the companion of that one who had stolen the ruby ring up he came and laid hold of the servant by the collar calling to his companions that he had caught one of the thieves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2509.mp3	into the house they hauled the poor servant and into the same room where he had been before and there sat the young man at a grand feast with his wife and all his friends around him but when the young man saw the poor serving man he came to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2510.mp3	and took him by the hand and set him beside himself at the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2511.mp3	it was the ring of discord that bred strife wherever it came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2512.mp3	my wife and all my friends fell out with me and we quarrelled so that they all left me but though i knew it not at that time your comrade was an angel and took the ring away with him and now i am as happy as i was sorrowful before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2513.mp3	rap tap tap he knocked at the door and the wise man who had been his master opened to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2514.mp3	very well said the wise man come in and shut the door and for all i know the travelling servant is there to this day for he is not the only one in the world who has come in sight of the fruit of happiness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2515.mp3	and then jogged all the way back home again to cook cabbage and onions and pot herbs and to make broth for wiser men than himself to sup
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2516.mp3	no offence said the blacksmith i meant not to speak ill of your story come come sir will you not take a pot of ale with me why said saint george somewhat mollified
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2517.mp3	i would as lief as not i liked the story well enough piped up the little tailor who had killed seven flies at a blow twas a good enough story of its sort but why does nobody tell a tale of good big giants and of wild boars and of unicorns
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2518.mp3	such as i killed in my adventures you wot of old ali baba had been sitting with his hands folded and his eyes closed now he opened them and looked at the little tailor

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2520.mp3	clattered the bottom of his canican against the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2521.mp3	come friend let us have it stop a bit said fortunatus what is this story mostly about it is said ali baba about two men betwixt whom there was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2522.mp3	two little crayfishes quarrel the day after the eels left the pond people talked of nothing else it was not that they were so much missed for the eels you know do not swim around in the daytime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2523.mp3	the larger people had been sorry to have them go and some of them felt that without the eels awake and stirring the pond was hardly a safe place at night i think it is a good deal safer remarked a minnow who usually said what she thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2524.mp3	of course i do not know why didn't you ask them said a stickleback why replied the minnow if i had gone to the eels and asked them that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2525.mp3	i have heard some queer things about the eels myself said the stickleback but i have never felt much afraid of them i suppose i am braver because i wear so many of my bones on the outside just then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2526.mp3	a wise old crayfish came along walking sidewise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2527.mp3	the crayfish stuck his tail into the mud he often did this when he was surprised it seemed to help him think when he had thought for a while he waved his big pinching claws and said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2528.mp3	it would be better for me not to tell what i think i used to live near them this showed that the wise old crayfish had been well brought up and knew he should not say unpleasant things about people if he could help it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2529.mp3	when there was need of it he could tell unpleasant truths and indeed that very evening he did say what he thought of the eels that was when he was teaching some young crayfishes his pupils
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2530.mp3	their mother had brought up a large family and was not strong she had just cast the shell which she had worn for a year and now she was weak and helpless until the new one should harden on her it is such a bother she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2531.mp3	but it is a comfort to think that the new one will last a year when i do get it while their mother was so weak the wise old crayfish amused the children and taught them things which all crayfishes should know every evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2532.mp3	they gathered around him some of them swimming to him some walking forward some sidewise and some backward it made no difference to them which way they came they were restless pupils and their teacher could not keep them from looking behind them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2533.mp3	each one had so many eyes that he could look at the teacher with a few and at the other little crayfishes with a few more and still have a good many eyes left with which to watch the tadpoles these eyes were arranged in two big bunches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2534.mp3	and unless you looked very closely you might think that they had only two eyes apiece they had good ears and there were also fine smelling bristles growing from their heads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2535.mp3	that he had not slept so much as usual and now when he should have been wide awake he felt exceedingly dull and stupid when he tried to walk his eight legs stumbled over each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2536.mp3	and the weak way in which he waved his pinching claw legs showed how tired he was after he had told his pupils the best way to hold their food with their pinching claws
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2537.mp3	one mischievous little fellow called out i want to know about the eels my mother would never let me go near them and now they've moved away and i won't ever see them and i think it's just horrid eels my children said their teacher
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2538.mp3	are long slender sharp nosed slippery people with a fringe of fins along their backs and another fringe along their bellies they breathe through very small gill openings in the backs of their heads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2539.mp3	they have large mouths and teeth in their mouths and they are always sticking out their lower jaws and how do began the biggest little crayfish ask me that to morrow said their teacher
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2540.mp3	stretching his eight walking legs and his two pinching claw legs and his tail paddles but remember this one thing if you ever see an eel get out of his way don't stop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2541.mp3	said one little crayfish who thought it smart to be saucy we'll look
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2542.mp3	all of which meant nothing at all and was only said to annoy his teacher they scrambled away over the pond bottom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2543.mp3	jiggling the young clams and racing with each other where the bottom was smooth beat you running backward cried the saucy crayfish to the biggest little crayfish and they scampered along backward in the moonlit water there was an old log on the bottom of the pond
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2544.mp3	and they sat on that to rest the biggest little crayfish had beaten
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2545.mp3	said the saucy one pooh said the biggest one that's all you know they don't run on land well i guess they do replied the saucy one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2546.mp3	that the eels had come back to live in the old pond again mother eel opened her big mouth very wide on land she said decidedly as she swallowed the biggest little crayfish eels wriggle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2547.mp3	one warm day in winter when some of the pussy willows made a mistake and began to grow because they thought spring had come a party of muskrats were visiting in the marsh beside the pond all around them were their winter houses built of mud and coarse grasses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2548.mp3	these homes looked like heaps of dried rushes unless one went close to them if one did that he could plainly see what they were and if one happened to be a muskrat and could dive and go into them through their watery doorways
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2549.mp3	and are awake at night we wish it would always be warm weather said the young muskrats what's the use of winter hard to tell answered one muskrat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2550.mp3	who had lived in the marsh longer than the rest hard to tell i know it always gives me a good appetite though then all the muskrats laughed they were a jolly good natured company and easy to get along with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2551.mp3	the other pond people liked them much better than they did their neighbors the minks the wild ducks who nested in the sedges were quite willing that the young muskrats should play with their children and the mud hens were not afraid of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2552.mp3	mud hens cannot bear minks they say that when a mud chicken is missing from the nest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2553.mp3	in spring and summer when they can find fresh grasses and young rushes or a few parsnips carrots and turnips from the farmers fields other animals are quite safe in the winter they live mostly on roots
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2554.mp3	yes great pity chuckled the old muskrat how glad you would be to see them he smiled all around his little mouth and showed his gnawing teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2555.mp3	he knew that the frogs were better off asleep in the mud at the bottom of the pond than they would be sitting in the sunshine with a few hungry gulls above them the turtles were sleeping all winter too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2556.mp3	the eels were lying at the bottom stupid and drowsy and somewhere the water adders were hidden away dreaming of spring of all the birds who lived by the water only the gulls were there and they were not popular
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2557.mp3	it is true that they helped keep the pond sweet and clean and picked up and carried away many things which made the shore untidy still they were rude and talked too loudly and wore their feathers in such a way that they looked like fine large birds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2558.mp3	the other pond people said that was just like them always pretending to be more than they really were fifteen young muskrats all brothers and sisters and all born the summer before started off to look at the old home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2559.mp3	where they were children together that is to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2560.mp3	and when they were old enough to look out for themselves five more came to live in the old nest and when these were old enough to leave the nest another five were born it doesn't mean so much to muskrats to be brothers and sisters as it does to some people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2561.mp3	and to hear them slap their long scaly tails on the water when they dove they had short downy fur almost black on the back soft gray underneath and a reddish brown everywhere else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2562.mp3	there was very little fur on their tails or on their feet and those parts were black these fifteen children had been fairly well brought up but you can see that their mother had many cares
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2563.mp3	so it is not strange if they sometimes behaved badly in some other families where there were only nine or ten babies all the season they had been brought up more strictly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2564.mp3	like all young muskrats they were full of fun and there were few pleasanter sights than to see them frolicking on a warm moonlight evening when they looked like brown balls rolling and bounding around on the shore or plunging into the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2565.mp3	if they had all been exactly the same age it would have been even pleasanter for the oldest five would put on airs and call the others the children and the next five would call the youngest five
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2566.mp3	babies although they were all well grown there was no chance for the youngest five to call other muskrats babies so when they were warm and well fed and good natured they laughed and said who cares
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2567.mp3	when they were cold and hungry they slapped their tails on the ground or on the water and said don't you think you're smart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2568.mp3	she would say now children in such a way that they had to stop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2569.mp3	teasing is not so very bad you know although it is dreadfully silly but when people begin by teasing they sometimes get to saying things in earnest even really hateful mean things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2570.mp3	and that was what made the muskrat father and mother stop it whenever they could now the whole fifteen crowded around the old summer home and some of them went in one way and some of them went in another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2571.mp3	for every muskrat's summer house has several burrows leading to it when they reached the old nest at the end all of them tried to get in at once and they pushed each other around with their broad little heads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2572.mp3	scrambled and clutched and held on with their strong little feet five of them said it's our turn first we're the oldest and five more said well it's our turn next anyway cause we're next oldest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2573.mp3	the others said you might give up to us because we're the youngest they pushed and scrambled some more and one of the youngest children said to one of the oldest well i don't care i'm just as big as you are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2574.mp3	which was so and the older one answered back well you're not so good looking which was also true then part of the brothers and sisters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2575.mp3	took sides with one and part took sides with the other what had been a lovely frolic became an unpleasant disgraceful quarrel and they said such things as these
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2576.mp3	you slapped your tail on my back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2577.mp3	or the half way between brothers and sisters should go first into the old nest and it didn't matter a bit who was oldest or who was youngest and it never would have happened had it not been for their dreadful habit of teasing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2578.mp3	but they were too much excited to mind and they did not stop until their father came and slapped them with his tail then they kept still and listened to their mother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2579.mp3	she told them that they should leave the place at once and not one of them should even set foot in the old nest suppose somebody had gotten hurt she said this made the young muskrats look very sober
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2580.mp3	for they knew that the muskrat who is hurt in winter never gets well after she had let them think about this for a while she said i shall punish you all for this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2581.mp3	then there was no quarrel among her children to see who should have the first turn not at all one young muskrat said aren't you going to let us play any more yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2582.mp3	but i shall choose the games the oldest five will play mud turtles in winter the next five will play frogs in winter and the youngest five will play snakes in winter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2583.mp3	the way to play these games is to lie perfectly still in some dark place and not say a word the young muskrats looked at each other sorrowfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2584.mp3	they thought it sounded very much the same as being sent to bed for being naughty they did not dare say anything for they knew that although their mother was gentle as muskrats are most of the time she could be very severe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2585.mp3	so they went away quietly to play what she had told them they must but it was not much fun to play those games when all the others were having a fine time in the sunshine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2586.mp3	the lucky mink during the warm weather the minks did not come often to the pond then they had to stay nearer home and care for their babies in the winter when food was not so plentiful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2587.mp3	and their youngest children were old enough to come with them they visited there every day it was not far from their home the minks lived by a waterfall in the river and had burrows in the banks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2588.mp3	where the young minks stayed until they were large enough to go out into the world then the fathers and mothers were very busy for in each home there were four or five or six children hungry and restless and needing to be taught many things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2589.mp3	they were related to the weasels who lived up by the farmyard and had the same slender and elegant bodies and short legs as they like the weasels they sometimes climbed trees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2590.mp3	they did most of their hunting in the river swimming with their bodies almost all under water and diving and turning and twisting gracefully and quickly when they hunted on land they could tell by smelling just which way to go for their food
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2591.mp3	the minks were a very dark brown and scattered through their close soft fur were long shining hairs of an even darker shade which made their coats very beautiful indeed the fur was darker on their backs than on the under part of their bodies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2592.mp3	and their tapering bushy tails were almost black their under jaws were white and they were very proud of them perhaps it was because they had so little white fur that they thought so much of it you know that is often the way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2593.mp3	we think most of those things which are scarce or hard to get there was one old mink by the river who had a white tip on his tail and that is something which many people have never seen it is even more uncommon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2594.mp3	than for minks to have white upper lips and that happens only once in a great while this mink was a bachelor and nobody knew why some people said it was because he was waiting to find a wife with a white tip on her tail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2595.mp3	yet that could not have been for he was too wise to wait for something which might never happen however it was he lived alone and fished and hunted just for himself he could dive more quickly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2596.mp3	stay under water longer and hunt by scent better than any other mink round there his fur was sleeker and more shining than that of his friends and it is no wonder that the sisters of his friends thought that he ought to marry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2597.mp3	when the minks visited together somebody was sure to speak of the bachelor's luck they said that whatever he did he was always lucky it is all because of a white tip on his tail they said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2598.mp3	that makes him lucky the young minks heard their fathers and mothers talking and wished that they had been born with white tips on their tails so that they could be lucky too once the bachelor heard them wishing this and he smiled and showed his beautiful teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2599.mp3	and told them that it was not the tip of his tail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2600.mp3	and the brothers were bigger than the sisters as mink brothers always are although they were all the same age one was very much larger than any of the rest and so they called him big brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2601.mp3	he thought there was never such a fine mink as the bachelor and he used to follow him around
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2602.mp3	he wished to be just like him in every way but one he did not want to be a bachelor the other young minks laughed at big brother and asked him if he thought his tail would turn white if he followed the bachelor long enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2603.mp3	big brother stood it very patiently for a while then he snarled at them and showed his teeth without smiling and said he would fight anybody who spoke another word about it minks are very brave and very fierce
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2604.mp3	and never know when to stop if they have begun to fight so after that nobody dared tease big brother by saying anything more about the bachelor sometimes they did look at his tail and smile but they never spoke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2605.mp3	and he pretended not to know what they meant by it a few days after this the bachelor was caught in a trap a common clumsy wooden trap put together with nails and twine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2606.mp3	it was not near the river and none of his friends would have found him if big brother had not happened along he could hardly believe what he saw was it possible that a trap had dared to catch a mink with a white tipped tail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2607.mp3	then he heard the bachelor groan and he knew that it was so he hurried up to where the trap was can't you get out said he no said the bachelor i can't the best way to get
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2608.mp3	out is not to get in and i've gotten in can't you do something with your lucky tail to make the trap open asked big brother i could do something with my teeth answered the bachelor if they were only where the tip of my tail is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2609.mp3	why are minks always walking into traps he was trying hard not to be cross but his eyes showed how he felt and that was very cross indeed then big brother became much excited
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2610.mp3	i have good teeth said he tell me what to do if you will help me out said the bachelor i will give you my luck and what shall i do with the tail i have asked the young mink
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2611.mp3	who thought that the bachelor was to give him his white tipped tail never mind now answered the bachelor and he told the young mink just where to gnaw for a long time there was no sound but that of the young mink's teeth on the wood of the trap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2612.mp3	the bachelor was too brave to groan or make a fuss when he knew there was anybody around to hear big brother's mouth became very sore and his stomach became very empty but still he kept at work he was afraid somebody would
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2613.mp3	come for the trap and the mink in it before he finished now try it said he after he had gnawed for quite a while the bachelor backed out as far as he could but his body stuck in the hole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2614.mp3	you are rumpling your beautiful fur cried the young mink never mind the fur answered the bachelor i can smooth that down afterward you will have to gnaw a little on this side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2615.mp3	and he raised one of his hind feet to show where he meant it was a beautiful hindfoot thickly padded and with short partly webbed toes and no hair at all growing between them the claws were short sharp and curved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2616.mp3	big brother gnawed away now try it said he the bachelor backed carefully out through the opening and stood there looking tired and hungry and very much rumpled you are a fine young mink said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2617.mp3	we will get something to eat and then we will see about making you lucky they went to the river bank and had a good dinner the bachelor ate more than big brother for his mouth was not sore but big brother was very happy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2618.mp3	he thought how handsome he would look with a white tipped tail and how after he had that he could surely marry whoever he wished it was the custom among his people to want to marry the best looking and strongest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2619.mp3	indeed it is so among all the pond people and that is one reason why they care so much about being good looking it is very hard for a young mink to have the one he loves choose somebody else just because the other fellow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2620.mp3	has the bushiest tail or the longest fur or the thickest pads on his feet now said the bachelor we will talk about luck we will go to a place where nobody can hear what we say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2621.mp3	they found such a place and lay down the bachelor rolled over three times and smoothed his fur he was still so tired from being in the trap then he looked at the young mink very sharply so you want my tail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2622.mp3	said he you said you would give me your luck answered big brother and everybody knows that your luck is in your tail the bachelor smiled what will you do with the tail you have said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2623.mp3	i don't know answered big brother you wouldn't want to wear two asked the bachelor oh no answered big brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2624.mp3	well how will you put my tail in place of yours asked the bachelor i don't know answered the young mink but you are so wise that i thought you might know some way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2625.mp3	he began to feel discouraged and to think that the bachelor's offer didn't mean very much after all don't you think said the bachelor slowly don't you think that if you could have my luck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2626.mp3	you could get along pretty well with your own tail why yes said the young mink who had begun to fear he was not going to get anything yes but how could that be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2627.mp3	the bachelor smiled again i always tell people said he that my luck is not in my tail and they never believe it i will tell you the secret of my luck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2628.mp3	and you can have luck like it if you really care enough he looked all around to make sure that nobody was near and he listened very carefully with the two little round ears that were almost hidden in his head fur then he whispered to big brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2629.mp3	this is the secret always do everything a little better than anybody else can is that all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2630.mp3	that is enough answered the bachelor keep trying and trying and trying until you can dive deeper stay under water longer run faster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2631.mp3	then you will have good luck when theirs is poor you will have plenty to eat when they are hungry you can beat in every fight you can have sleek shining fur

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2664.mp3	but whether or not the service has for a moment embodied itself in material form is of no essential economic import
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2665.mp3	but a similar distinction is inconsistently preserved by many writers in the case of material things a building used as a factory is called productive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2666.mp3	but used by the owner as a dwelling it is called unproductive because the service it renders does not appear in material form but the use of the house or that of land for a school ground or campus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2667.mp3	and thus his felt dependence on goods extends over a series of future productive agents in order to simplify the problem we have spoken of the economic man as living only in and for the moment

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2699.mp3	the increase of rents is due to two causes changes in the agents by which they become more efficient technically or more numerous and changes taking place outside of the agents

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2720.mp3	that the less efficient rented agents are thrown out of use and the margin of utilization is moved to a higher plane than it was on before improved types of machinery more or less rapidly displace the older

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2759.mp3	to suffer him to rest and when he arose the old man rose too and stood with him at the door look he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2760.mp3	at the water which lies far out yonder and the plains which stretch beyond
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2761.mp3	but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2762.mp3	instead of hiding as he approached and birds circled round him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2763.mp3	very soon he noticed with wonder that neither rocks nor trees barred his path he passed through them without knowing it for indeed they were not rocks and trees at all but only the souls of them for this was the land of shadows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2764.mp3	when to his joy and wonder he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own the maiden for whose sake he had made this long journey but they could not touch each other for between them rolled great waves which looked as if they would sink the boats
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2765.mp3	only the children had no fear and reached the other side in safety still though the chief and the young girl quailed in terror at these horrible sights and sounds no harm came to them for their lives had been free from evil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2766.mp3	so they reached unhurt the shore of the happy island and wandered through the flowery fields and by the banks of rushing streams and they knew not hunger nor thirst neither cold nor heat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2767.mp3	but in the murmur of the wind he heard the master of life saying to him return whither you came for i have work for you to do and your people need you and for many years you shall rule over them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2768.mp3	at the gate my messenger awaits you and you shall take again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2769.mp3	one of them said to the others if we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows how shall we set about it the other said do you see that large cornfield there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2770.mp3	if we were to hide ourselves in that no one could find us the army cannot come into it and to morrow it is to march on they crept into the corn but the army did not march on but remained encamped close around them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2771.mp3	they sat for two days and two nights in the corn and grew so hungry that they nearly died but if they were to venture out it was certain death they said at last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2772.mp3	what use was it our deserting we must perish here miserably whilst they were speaking a fiery dragon came flying through the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2773.mp3	said they then the dragon seized them in his claws took them through the air over the army and set them down on the earth a long way from it he gave them a little whip saying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2774.mp3	then he put a book before them which he made all three of them sign i will then give you a riddle he said if you guess it you shall be free and out of my power the dragon then flew away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2775.mp3	and they journeyed on with their little whip they had as much money as they wanted wore grand clothes and made their way into the world wherever they went they lived in merrymaking and splendour drove about with horses and carriages ate and drank but did nothing wrong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2776.mp3	they went into a field sat down and the two pulled long faces an old woman passed by and asked them why they were so sad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2777.mp3	only confide your trouble in me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2778.mp3	and how he had given them money as plentifully as blackberries but as they had signed their names they were his unless when the seven years had passed they could guess a riddle the old woman said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2779.mp3	if you would help yourselves one of you must go into the wood and there he will come upon a tumble down building of rocks which looks like a little house he must go in and there he will find help the two melancholy ones thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2780.mp3	that won't save us and they remained where they were but the third and merry one jumped up and went into the wood till he found the rock hut in the hut sat a very old woman who was the dragon's grandmother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2781.mp3	she asked him how he came and what was his business there he told her all that happened and because she was pleased with him she took compassion on him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2782.mp3	i will tell you this in the north sea lies a dead sea cat that shall be their roast meat and the rib of a whale that shall be their silver spoon and the hollow foot of a dead horse that shall be their wineglass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2783.mp3	i know enough and can help myself splendidly then he went by another way through the window secretly and in all haste back to his comrades he told them how the dragon had been outwitted by his grandmother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2784.mp3	and how he had heard from his own lips the answer to the riddle then they were all delighted and in high spirits took out their whip and cracked so much money that it came jumping up from the ground when the seven years had quite gone the fiend came with his book and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2785.mp3	pointing at the signatures said i will take you underground with me you shall have a meal there if you can tell me what you will get for your roast meat you shall be free
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2786.mp3	then said the first soldier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2787.mp3	the dragon made a face and growled again three times hum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2788.mp3	do you know what your wineglass shall be an old horse's hoof shall be our wineglass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2789.mp3	once there lived a king who had no children for many years after his marriage at length heaven granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate for her as fairer than a fairy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2790.mp3	than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it and either to torment her cruelly or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men the eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge this fairy was named lagree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2791.mp3	she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2792.mp3	she was also so spiteful that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or ill natured tricks of the whole body of fairies with her large experience added to her native spite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2793.mp3	she felt a little reassured and was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2794.mp3	at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate she then gave two glass bottles into the princess's charge desiring her to take the greatest care of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2795.mp3	and having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience she vanished leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2796.mp3	several years passed during which time the princess grew accustomed to her lonely life obeyed the fairy's orders and by degrees forgot all about the court of the king her father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2797.mp3	she noticed that the sun's rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a brilliant rainbow she stood still to admire it when to her great surprise she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come from the centre of its rays
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2798.mp3	the voice was that of a young man and its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming but this had to be a mere matter of fancy for no one was visible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2799.mp3	the beautiful rainbow informed fairer than a fairy that he was young the son of a powerful king and that the fairy lagree who owed his parents a grudge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2800.mp3	had revenged herself by depriving him of his natural shape for some years that she had imprisoned him in the palace where he had found his confinement hard to bear for some time but now he owned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2801.mp3	he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love fairer than a fairy he added many other tender speeches to this declaration and the princess to whom such remarks were a new experience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2802.mp3	could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions the prince could only appear or speak under the form of a rainbow and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2803.mp3	lagree on her return soon found out the neglect and seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2804.mp3	for fire with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out now this locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he came across and especially enjoyed a chance of catching
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2805.mp3	and eating any young girls our heroine obeyed with great sweetness and without having been able to take leave of her lover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2806.mp3	as to certain death as she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by and to use it when needed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2807.mp3	she took the bird's advice and in due time arrived at the house of locrinos luckily she only found his wife at home who was much struck by the princess's youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2808.mp3	she readily let fairer than a fairy have the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2809.mp3	convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain and fairer than a fairy carried out his plan daily with entire success every morning she placed a large basin full of water on her window sill and as soon as the sun's rays fell on the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2810.mp3	the rainbow appeared as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain by this means they were able to meet without losing sight of the fire or of the two bottles in which the old fairy kept her eye and her tooth at night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2811.mp3	and for some time the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe he had just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot but he had no idea where he was to go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2812.mp3	the poor young couple were in despair and only parted with the last ray of sunshine and in hopes of meeting next morning alas next day was dark and gloomy and it was only late in the afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2813.mp3	fairer than a fairy eagerly ran to the window but in her haste she upset the basin and spilt all the water with which she had carefully filled it overnight no other water was at hand except that in the two bottles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2814.mp3	it was the only chance of seeing her lover before they were separated and she did not hesitate to break the bottle and pour their contents into the basin when the rainbow appeared at once their farewells were full of tenderness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2815.mp3	the prince made the most ardent and sincere protestations and promised to neglect nothing which might help to deliver his dear fairer than a fairy from her captivity and implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both be free
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2816.mp3	the princess on her side vowed to have no other husband and declared herself willing to brave death itself in order to rejoin him they were not allowed much time for their adieus the rainbow vanished and the princess resolved to run all risks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2817.mp3	started off at once taking nothing with her but her dog her cat a sprig of myrtle and the stone which the wife of locrinos gave her when lagree became aware of her prisoner's flight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2818.mp3	as she did so the sprig of myrtle she carried touched the ground and immediately a green and shady bower sprang up round her in which she hoped to sleep in peace but lagree had not given up her pursuit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2819.mp3	and arrived just as fairer than a fairy had fallen fast asleep this time she made sure of catching her victim but the cat spied her out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2820.mp3	she flew at lagree's face and tore out her only eye thus delivering the princess for ever from her persecutor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2821.mp3	but no sooner had lagree been put to fight than our heroine was overwhelmed with hunger and thirst she felt as though she should certainly expire and it was with some difficulty that she dragged herself as far
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2822.mp3	which stood at no great distance here she was received by a beautiful lady dressed in green and white to match the house which apparently belonged to her and of which she seemed the only inhabitant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2823.mp3	she gave her a nut desiring her only to open it in the most urgent need after a long and tiring journey fairer than a fairy was once more received in a house and by a lady exactly like the one she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2824.mp3	here again she received a present with the same injunctions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2825.mp3	that they wished their houses and garments to be equally alike their occupation consisted in helping those in misfortune and they were as gentle and benevolent as lagree had been cruel and spiteful the third fairy comforted the poor traveller
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2826.mp3	begged her not to lose heart and assured her that her troubles should be rewarded she accompanied her advice by the gift of a crystal smelling bottle with strict orders only to open it in case of urgent need
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2827.mp3	fairer than a fairy thanked her warmly and resumed her way cheered by pleasant thoughts after a time her road led through a wood full of soft airs and sweet odours and before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a wonderful silver castle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2828.mp3	fairer than a fairy felt a strong desire to enter this castle but besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be neither doors nor windows she had no doubt though really i cannot think why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2829.mp3	that the moment had come in which to use the nut which had been given her she opened it and out came a diminutive hall porter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2830.mp3	you ever saw the princess climbed up one of the silver chains holding in her hand the little porter who in spite of his minute size opened a secret door with his golden key and let her in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2831.mp3	she entered a magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire castle and which was lighted by gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2832.mp3	who now saw him for the first time in his real shape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2833.mp3	on opening it found that all the seeds were as many little violins which flew up in the vaulted roof and at once began playing melodiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2834.mp3	the prince was not completely roused but he opened his eyes a little and looked all the handsomer impatient at not being recognised fairer than a fairy now drew out her third present and on opening the crystal scent bottle a little syren flew out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2835.mp3	at the same moment the walls of the room expanded and opened out revealing a golden throne covered with jewels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2836.mp3	in the first and most splendid of these carriages sat prince rainbow's mother she fondly embraced her son after which she informed him that his father had been dead for some years that the anger of the fairies was at length appeased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2837.mp3	and that he might return in peace to reign over his people who were longing for his presence the court received the new king with joyful acclamations which would have delighted him at any other time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2838.mp3	he was just about to present her to his mother and the court

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2840.mp3	to his astonishment he found an old woman who begged him to help her out of the ditch the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there my son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2841.mp3	answered the old woman i am a very poor woman and soon after midnight i set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning but i lost my way in the dark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2842.mp3	over there at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance replied the old woman the prince lifted her on to his horse and soon they reached the hut where the old woman got down and turning to the prince said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2843.mp3	just wait a moment and i will give you something and she disappeared into her hut but returned very soon and said you are a mighty prince but at the same
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2844.mp3	which deserves to be rewarded would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife most certainly i would replied the prince so the old woman continued

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2848.mp3	and his horse had died of exhaustion while he himself had suffered much from want and misery but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of at last one day he came to a hut in front of which sat a very old man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2849.mp3	no i do not answered the old man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2850.mp3	the prince thanked him for his information and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road and at the end of it came to the little hut where he found a very old man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2851.mp3	he asked him the same question and the old man answered no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2852.mp3	with diamond windows he opened the big gate leading into the courtyard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2853.mp3	when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted the prince replied

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2860.mp3	and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him and the king of the eagles sank at his feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2861.mp3	the bird said you are looking for the mother dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds i will summon all the eagles of the air together and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you and with these words the king of the eagles flew away

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2878.mp3	things went very smoothly at gore hall after durham had established lucy as its mistress during the absence of bernard the girl herself firmly believed that her cousin was dead and assumed deep mourning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2879.mp3	and felt his loss deeply it was her outspoken affection that provoked a quarrel between her and julius and which led to the breaking of their engagement lucy had a high temper which had been kept in subjection during the life of sir simon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2880.mp3	but now that she tasted the sweets of power she was not disposed to allow julius to treat her as he chose missus gilroy came back from her visit to the lawyer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2881.mp3	she saw that she had gone too far and had given durham an inkling as to the possibility of michael having masqueraded as bernard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2882.mp3	knowing that she had married walter gore and although there was a flaw in the circumstances upon which she built her claim yet she trusted to her own cleverness to conceal this from the too clever lawyer but apart from this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2883.mp3	the fact that he suspected someone of passing himself off as bernard startled her and opened an abyss at her feet on leaving the office she judged it best to lower her crest for the moment and to wait patiently to see what would transpire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2884.mp3	missus gilroy was a well educated woman and very astute therefore she hoped to gain her ends by craft if not by force so far she had failed but she did not intend to abandon her claim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2885.mp3	for one failure as it was she came back to the hall and behaved herself much better than she had ever done before she was respectful to lucy and did not display her impatience of commands that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2886.mp3	she had hitherto done no one could have been meeker and although miss randolph did not like or trust the woman she had no fault to find with her in any way lucy suffered severely from the shock of sir simon's tragic death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2887.mp3	and from the supposed death of sir bernard in fact the matter so preyed on her nerves that she became prostrate and doctor payne had to be called in he was a handsome and popular young doctor who had practiced in hurseton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2888.mp3	he was naturally very pleased and was very attentive a complete rest is what you need he said to miss randolph

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2891.mp3	probably but she bears up wonderfully but that she is in mourning one would hardly guess she had sustained such a loss was she very much attached to mister gore yes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2904.mp3	why do you think bernard is innocent he asked because if he is guilty his action gives the lie to his whole life julius she replied raising herself on her elbow i can't believe he killed my uncle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2905.mp3	sir simon is not your uncle said beryl jealously you are only a distant relative perhaps my marriage with you may make me a nearer one

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2907.mp3	why did you accept me then what else could i do it was sir simon's wish that we should marry and owing to my circumstances i had no choice in the matter during his life i was merely a puppet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2908.mp3	although you swore for an hour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2909.mp3	you told sir simon about bernard being in love with alice that the poor boy might be disinherited beryl did not deny the charge i believe you are in love with bernard yourself he said

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2911.mp3	lucy sat up on the sofa and pushed the loose hair back from her forehead why do you say that she asked sharply julius stared at the fire i can't understand durham's attitude he said evasively
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2912.mp3	he must know that bernard is dead seeing that the coat and hat were found on the banks of the river no man could have lived in the cold and the fog yet if durham was sure he would not hold the estate against bernard's coming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2913.mp3	mister durham requires proof of the death rejoined lucy sharply and until then he is bound to administer the estate according to the will as bernard's body has not been found
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2914.mp3	there is always a chance that he may have escaped i sincerely trust not ah you always hated bernard on the contrary i speak for his good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2915.mp3	what's the use of his coming to life when he must suffer for his crime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2916.mp3	you have no grounds for saying that said julius pale with rage i don't need grounds retorted the genuine woman bernard always was as kind hearted as you were and are the reverse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2917.mp3	i am not hard hearted snapped beryl i always do good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2918.mp3	not always for instance i am down here to get a small boy a post with miss plantagenet as a page that is very good of you said lucy scornfully ah you see i can do a kind action
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2919.mp3	this boy is a grandson of lord conniston's housekeeper missus moon at cove castle said lucy with some color in her face i know do you know lord conniston asked julius suspiciously i have met him once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2920.mp3	he seems to be a most delightful fellow what a delightful speech for a lady said beryl conniston is a scamp i heard he enlisted in the lancers it shows how brave he is every man worth calling a man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2921.mp3	should go to the front perhaps you would like me to go sneered julius you would never have the pluck said lucy quickly all your ends in life are gained by cunning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2922.mp3	lucy if you talk to me like that began beryl and then restrained himself with an effort it is no use our quarrelling let me show you that i am not so careless of others or so hard hearted as i seem to be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2923.mp3	miss plantagenet wants a page i found this lad in london selling matches he was a messenger boy at a tobacconist called taberley and lord conniston got him turned out of the situation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2924.mp3	the boy told me himself he will tell you if you like to see him i don't want to see him lord conniston is too kind a man to behave in that way he was fond of bernard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2925.mp3	and that makes him perfect in your eyes said beryl looking savage see here lucy conniston has left the army so you see he is not so brave as you think
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2926.mp3	he left so as to seek after bernard said lucy quickly mister durham told me so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2927.mp3	and i believe bernard may be alive after all in which case you would give him up to the police no said julius with an emotion which did him credit i should never betray him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2928.mp3	lucy if you can find out from lord conniston or durham that bernard is alive let me know and i'll see what i can do to help him how can you help him when you believe him guilty i might help him to escape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2929.mp3	i don't want to see him hanged he won't be hanged if lord conniston and mister durham can save him ah julius started to his feet then he is alive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2930.mp3	i can't say i have no reason to think he is but i am hoping against hope said lucy rising i merely state what was said mister durham and lord conniston both told alice that bernard was innocent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2931.mp3	they will find it difficult to prove that sneered beryl with a white face i believe the fellow is alive after all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2932.mp3	and then asked lucy starting up and facing beryl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2933.mp3	ah you would make him pay money to save himself i have a right to a portion of the estate you have not said miss randolph clenching her fists and all her languor gone bernard is the owner of gore hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2934.mp3	and of all the property and of the title also
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2935.mp3	his name will be cleared and then you will throw me over and try to become lady gore i throw you over now said lucy losing her temper and coloring hotly how dare you speak to me like this julius
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2936.mp3	i will no longer be bound to you i never loved you but i have always tried to see the best side of you but you have no good side you are a mean cowardly serpent and if bernard is alive i shall do my best to defend him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2937.mp3	from your snares but lucy don't speak to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2938.mp3	i give you back your ring here it is she wrenched it from her finger now leave the house mister beryl i am mistress here julius looked at the ring which she had thrown at his feet and laughed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2939.mp3	you take a high tone he said sneeringly but remember that if bernard is dead the money goes to charities so much the better you do not get it nor you either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2940.mp3	you will have to turn out of this luxurious home and live on the pittance sir simon left you would i be better off if i married you i think you would i have not much money now but i will have some
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2941.mp3	a great deal some day by blackmailing bernard said lucy indignantly julius picked up the ring and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket calmly we don't know that bernard is alive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2942.mp3	but the fact of conniston leaving the army and from durham's attitude i shrewdly suspect he is and in hiding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2943.mp3	and then it depends upon him whether he is hanged or prefers to live abroad on a portion of his money the lesser portion i know the price of your silence said lucy vehemently you will want the hall and a large income
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2944.mp3	all i can get rejoined beryl quietly and you have refused to share my fortune with me yes i will have nothing to do with you and remember that if i catch you plotting i will tell mister durham
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2945.mp3	you can tell him the whole of this conversation snarled beryl i am not afraid of durham if bernard is alive he'll have to pay up or be hanged he is innocent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2946.mp3	julius shrugged his shoulders and walked to the door there he paused to utter a final insulting speech i don't know whether you intend to marry bernard or lord conniston he said but i wish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2947.mp3	which ever it is joy of a spitfire and an honest woman said miss randolph wrathfully for the reference to conniston touched her nearly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2948.mp3	but you go too fast you can't yet prove that bernard lives i go to do so sneered julius and bowed himself ironically out of the room leaving lucy furious both with him and with herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2949.mp3	she was angry with herself because she felt that in speaking of conniston she had colored and as a matter of fact she greatly admired the young lord even though they had only met once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2950.mp3	for conniston was one of those irresistible men who appeal to women lucy thought but it matters little what she thought all she knew was that her engagement to julius which had always weighed on her conscience was at an end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2951.mp3	i am free now free she said stretching her hands oh what an escape i have had from that wicked man he has shown his hand too plainly i will put mister durham on his guard and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2952.mp3	here she blushed and lord conniston julius walking towards the bower was also angry with himself as lucy thought he had shown his hand too clearly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2953.mp3	it would have been better he considered to have held my tongue i should have done so had she not goaded me into speech she will tell durham and that interfering conniston and put them on their guard well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2954.mp3	he laughed and looked at the small boy trotting beside him i am equal to both the boy was a handsome innocent looking little fellow rather undersized
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2955.mp3	with his clear skin his fair hair and wide blue eyes he looked like the conventional picture of a cherub
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2956.mp3	but his mind had not yet had time to work on his face and the mask of his childhood for he was only thirteen concealed his evil nature successfully in a few years when his passions worked their way through the mask his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2957.mp3	would be wrinkled and sinful his mind would have marked plainly its signet on the smooth surface but at present he looked charmingly innocent although he already knew much more about life than was good for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2958.mp3	julius in order that the lad might make an impression on miss plantagenet had dressed him in a new suit and pleased with himself for much of the boy remained in this precocious criminal young jerry trotted along smiling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2959.mp3	jerry said beryl looking down mind you are nice to the old lady jerry tossed his fair curls and looked roguish oh that's all right mister beryl all old ladies take to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2960.mp3	they think i'm a kind of holy bill and i let them think so it pays jerry you are a young scamp of the worst the boy chuckled as though he had received a compliment i like doing things he explained frankly it's fun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2961.mp3	if it hadn't been for victoria
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2962.mp3	you know nothing about such things corrected the respectable mister beryl severely i know a jolly sight more than you think said the urchin under his breath and producing a cigarette julius took it from him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2963.mp3	and dull said jerry putting his hands in his pockets lord what a bore stopping with her will be but i can nip over and see victoria when i like and keep an eye on lord conniston as i told you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2964.mp3	i'm fly said master moon and began whistling julius looked at him with satisfaction he intended that the boy should remain in the neighborhood so as to keep watch on conniston
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2965.mp3	on durham and on alice malleson for this last reason he was introducing him into the house if bernard were alive as julius began to suspect he would come to one of these three people and then jerry would at once become aware of the fact
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2966.mp3	miss berengaria was as usual in the garden looking after the well being of some white chrysanthemums she raised her head when she saw her visitors and a look of annoyance crossed her face when she saw mister beryl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2967.mp3	and but for the sake of alice she would have refused to let him enter the bower as it was and with great diplomacy so great that it deceived even the astute beryl she asked him to come into the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2968.mp3	luckily alice was out of the way having gone to pay a visit but she was expected back momentarily and miss berengaria wished to get rid of julius before the girl returned she might be able to conceal her real feelings but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2969.mp3	alice being so young and impulsive might show her dislike too plainly and put beryl on his guard who is this you have here asked miss plantagenet putting on her spectacles and surveying jerry with admiration what a pretty lad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2970.mp3	he is a lad i wish you to help said beryl blandly last time we met miss plantagenet you mentioned that you wanted a page not exactly a page said the old dame rubbing her nose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2971.mp3	a sure sign she was perplexed merely a boy to see after the fowls and to wait about the house when necessary i love fowls said jerry sweetly and looking as innocent as a babe and dogs and things like that

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2975.mp3	it is not to lord conniston's credit but i must know the reason said the old dame sharply if you want me to take the lad into my service jerry in answer to a look of beryl's began to weep ostentatiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2976.mp3	i saw his lordship dressed as a soldier he snuffled and i told mister beryl his lordship was so angry that he got me turned off saying i was ungrateful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2977.mp3	you should always hold your tongue said miss berengaria angrily you had no right to tell what lord conniston wished kept secret it was only a freak on his part he left the army at my request
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2978.mp3	at your request said julius looking at her directly forearmed as she was miss berengaria with the consciousness of bernard's secret flushed through her withered skin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2979.mp3	but turned the conversation defiantly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2980.mp3	yes sweet lady don't talk like that child call me ma'am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2981.mp3	mister beryl such a kind gentleman ma'am said you would help me i will so long as you are honest jerry thrust his tongue in his cheek but julius answered

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/2989.mp3	but he was determined to go even though he should have to walk every step of the road and live on fruits that he could gather by the way he was a bright clever boy who had spent his life hitherto in a village but was now eager to go out into the world

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3034.mp3	this book is called the koran which means like our own word bible the book
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3035.mp3	three when mohammed returned home after the angel had first spoken to him he told his wife of what he had seen and heard she at once believed and so became a convert to the new religion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3036.mp3	she fell upon her knees at the feet of her husband and cried out there is but one god mohammed is god's prophet mohammed then told the story to other members of his family some of them believed and became his first followers

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3039.mp3	he went on telling about the appearance of gabriel and preaching the doctrines which he said the angel had ordered him to teach the people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3040.mp3	at such times his face grew pale as death his eyes became red and staring he spoke in a loud voice and his body trembled violently then he would tell what he had seen in his vision

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3042.mp3	about this time mohammed's uncle and wife died and he had then hardly any friends in mecca he therefore resolved to leave that city and go to medina numbers of the people there believed his doctrines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3043.mp3	and wished him to come and live among them so he secretly left his native town and fled from his enemies with a few faithful companions he made his escape to medina
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3044.mp3	that mohammed fled from mecca this event is very important in mohammedan history it is called the flight of the prophet or the hej'i ra
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3045.mp3	the remainder of his life a splendid church was built for him in medina it was called a mosque and all mohammedan churches or places of worship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3046.mp3	he gained many victories he marched against mecca with an army of ten thousand men and the city surrendered with little resistance the people then joined his religion and destroyed their idols

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3048.mp3	that the body still lies in the coffin in the same state as when it was first buried
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3049.mp3	that the coffin of mohammed rests somewhere between heaven and earth suspended in the air but this fable was invented by enemies to bring ridicule on the prophet and his religion

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3054.mp3	but has become dark from being wept upon and touched by so many millions of pilgrims it really is reddish brown in color before the time of mohammed the ka'a ba was a pagan temple
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3055.mp3	but when he took possession of mecca he made the old temple the centre of worship for his own religion after mohammed died a person was appointed to be his successor as head of the moslem church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3056.mp3	and this title has been borne ever since by the religious chief of the mohammedans in modern times the sultans or rulers of turkey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3057.mp3	when he was but twenty one years of age he was lame in one leg and looked as if he were a very ordinary person like most of the vandals he was a cruel and cunning man but he had great ability in many ways
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3058.mp3	but a plot was formed against him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3059.mp3	and that he was going to make war against rome at the same time he wrote secretly to count boniface and told him that if he came to rome the empress would put him to death boniface believed this story
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3060.mp3	he also sent a letter to genseric inviting him to come to africa with an army genseric was greatly delighted to receive the invitation from boniface he had long wanted to attack rome and take from her some of the rich countries she had conquered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3061.mp3	and marched into other parts of the coast and captured towns and cities by this time boniface had learned all about the wicked plot of aetius he now regretted having invited the vandals to africa and tried to induce them to return to spain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3062.mp3	but genseric sternly refused never he said shall i go back to spain until i am master of africa then cried boniface i will drive you back soon afterwards there was a battle between the romans and vandals and the romans were defeated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3063.mp3	they were also defeated in several other battles at last they had to flee for safety to two or three towns which the vandals had not yet taken one of these towns was hippo genseric captured this town
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3064.mp3	destroys valuable property a great many of the natives of africa joined the army of genseric they had for a long time been ill treated by the romans and were glad to see them defeated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3065.mp3	he built great fleets and sailed over the mediterranean capturing trading vessels for many years he plundered towns along the coasts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3066.mp3	after ruling several years valentinian had just been murdered by a roman noble named maximus who had at once made himself emperor when the messenger entered the room where genseric was he said great king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3067.mp3	i bring you a message from the empress eudoxia she begs your help she and her two beautiful daughters are in danger in rome she wishes you to protect them against maximus she invites you to come with an army to rome and take the city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3068.mp3	she and her friends will help you as much as they can with a cry of joy genseric sprang to his feet and exclaimed tell the empress that i accept her invitation i shall set out for rome immediately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3069.mp3	i shall set out for rome immediately i shall protect eudoxia and her friends genseric then got ready a fleet and a great army and sailed across the mediterranean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3070.mp3	to the mouth of the tiber when the emperor maximus heard that the vandals were coming he prepared to flee from the city and he advised the senate to do the same the people were so angry at this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3071.mp3	it was only forty five years since alaric had been there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3072.mp3	but since then rome had become again grand and wealthy so there was plenty for genseric and his vandals to carry away they spent fourteen days in the work of plunder they sacked the temples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3073.mp3	and public buildings and private houses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3074.mp3	some years after the capture of rome by genseric there was a roman emperor named ma jo'ri an he was a good ruler and a brave man the vandals still continued to attack and plunder cities in italy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3075.mp3	and other countries belonging to rome and majorian resolved to punish them so he got together a great army and built a fleet of three hundred ships to carry his troops to carthage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3076.mp3	but he first marched his men across the alps through gaul and down to the seaport of carthagena in spain where his fleet was stationed he took this route because he expected to add to his forces
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3077.mp3	as he went along before sailing with his army for carthage he wished very much to see with his own eyes what sort of people the vandals were and whether they were so powerful at home as was generally believed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3078.mp3	and entertained him hospitably not knowing that he was the emperor majorian of course peace was not made the emperor left carthage after having got as much information as he could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3079.mp3	but genseric did not wait for the roman fleet to come to attack him in his capital when he got word that it was in the bay of carthagena he sailed there with a fleet of his own and in a single day burned or sank nearly all the roman ships
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3080.mp3	after this the vandals became more than ever the terror of the mediterranean and all the countries bordering upon it every year their ships went round the coasts from asia minor to spain attacking and plundering cities on their way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3081.mp3	and carrying off prisoners all the efforts of the romans failed to put a stop to these ravages the emperor leo who ruled over the eastern division of the empire fitted out a great fleet at constantinople
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3082.mp3	to make another attempt to suppress the pirates there were more than a thousand ships in this fleet and they carried a hundred thousand men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3083.mp3	the brother of emperor leo's wife basilicus sailed with his ships to africa and landed the army not far from carthage genseric asked for a truce for five days to consider terms of peace and the truce was granted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3084.mp3	but the cunning vandal was not thinking of peace he only wanted time to carry out a plan he had made to destroy the roman fleet one dark night during the truce he filled the largest of his ships
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3085.mp3	in among the roman ships towing behind them large boats filled with material that would easily burn these boats were set on fire and floated against the roman vessels which also were soon on fire the flames quickly spread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3086.mp3	and in a very short time a great part of the roman fleet was destroyed basilicus fled with as many ships as he could save and returned to constantinople this was the last attempt of the romans to conquer the vandals

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3152.mp3	as i passed through the upper entry veronica opened her door she was undressed and had a little book in her hand which she shook at me saying

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3154.mp3	i looked out on a tranquil agreeable landscape there was nothing saline in the atmosphere the western breeze which blew in our faces had an earthy scent with fluctuating streams of odors from trees and flowers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3155.mp3	as we passed through the town cousin charles pointed to the academy which stood at the head of a green pretty houses stood round it and streets branched from it in all directions flower gardens shrubbery and trees were scattered everywhere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3156.mp3	rosville was larger and handsomer than surrey that is my house on the right he said we looked down the shady street through which we were going
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3157.mp3	and peaked roof and on the side toward us a large yard and stables we drove into the yard and a woman came out on the piazza to receive us it was missus morgeson or my wife cousin alice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3158.mp3	as mister morgeson introduced her giving us a cordial welcome she led us into a parlor where tea was waiting a servant came in for our bonnets and baskets cousin alice begged us to take tea at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3159.mp3	we were hardly seated when we heard the cry of a young child she left the table hastily to come back in a moment with an apology which she made to cousin charles rather than to us i had never seen a table so well arranged
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3160.mp3	so fastidiously neat it glittered with glass and french china cousin charles sent away a glass and a plate frowning at the girl who waited there must have been a speck or a flaw in them the viands were as pretty as the dishes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3161.mp3	the lamb chops were fragile the bread was delicious but cut in transparent slices and the butter pat was nearly stamped through with its bouquet of flowers this was all the feast except sponge cake which felt like muslin in the fingers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3162.mp3	i could have squeezed the whole of it into my mouth still hungry i observed that cousin charles and alice had finished and though she shook her spoon in the cup feigning to continue and he snipped crumbs in his plate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3163.mp3	i felt constrained to end my repast he rose then and pushing back folding doors we entered a large room leaving alice at the table windows extending to the floor opening on the piazza
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3164.mp3	but notwithstanding the stream of light over the carpet i thought it somber and out of keeping with the cottage exterior
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3165.mp3	the furniture was dark the mantel and table tops were black marble and the vases and candelabra were bronze he directed mother's attention to the portraits of his children explaining them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3166.mp3	dark and delicate but to look at it made me shiver mother came toward us pleading fatigue as an excuse for retiring and cousin charles called cousin alice who went with us to our room in the morning she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3167.mp3	we should see her three children she never left them she was so afraid of their being ill also telling mother that she would do all in her power to make my stay in rosville pleasant and profitable as a mother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3168.mp3	she could appreciate her anxiety and sadness in leaving me mother thanked her warmly and was sure that i should be happy but i had an inward misgiving that i should not have enough to eat i hear edward said alice good night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3169.mp3	presently a girl the same who had taken our bonnets came in with a pitcher of warm water and a plate of soda biscuit she directed us where to find the apparel she had nicely smoothed and folded took off the handsome counterpane and the pillows trimmed with lace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3170.mp3	putting others of a plainer make in their places shook down the window curtains asked us if we would have anything more and quietly disappeared i offered mother the warm water and appropriated the biscuits there were six i ate every one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3171.mp3	undressing meanwhile and surveying the apartment cassy missus morgeson is an excellent housekeeper yes i said huskily for the dry biscuit choked me what would temperance and hepsey say to this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3172.mp3	i think they would grumble and admire look at this showing her the tassels of the inner window curtains done up in little bags and the glass is pinned up with nice yellow paper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3173.mp3	and here is a damask napkin fastened to the wall behind the washstand and everything stands on a mat i wonder if this is to be my room it is probably the chamber for visitors why

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3175.mp3	which was not the one we had taken tea in but a small apartment with a door opening into the garden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3176.mp3	and their mother was tending and watching them the oldest was eight years the youngest three months cousin alice gave us descriptions of their tastes and habits dwelling with emphasis on those of the baby
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3177.mp3	i drew from her conversation the opinion that she had a tendency to the rearing of children i was glad when cousin charles came in looking at his watch send off the babies alice and ring the bell for breakfast she sent out the two youngest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3178.mp3	put little edward in his chair and breakfast began missus morgeson said charles the horses will be ready to take you round rosville we will call on doctor price for you to see the kind of master cassandra will have i have already spoken to him about receiving a new pupil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3179.mp3	i said mother tried in vain to look hard hearted and to persuade that it was good for me but she lost her appetite with the thought of losing me which the mention of doctor price brought home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3180.mp3	the ham was most savory but cut in such thin slices that it curled and the biscuits were as white and feathery as snowflakes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3181.mp3	cousin alice gave unremitting attention to edward who ate as little as the rest mother i said afterward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3182.mp3	i noticed how elegant their table appointments were and i shall buy new china in boston to morrow i wish hepsey would not load our table as she does hepsey is a good woman mother do give my love to her now that i think of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3183.mp3	she was always making up some nice dish tell her i remember it will you when cousin charles put us into the carriage and hoisted little edward on the front seat mother noticed that two men held the horses and that they were not the same he had driven the night before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3184.mp3	she said she was afraid to go they looked ungovernable but he reassured her and one of the men averring that mister morgeson could drive anything she repressed her fears and we drove out of the yard behind a pair of horses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3185.mp3	that stood on their hind legs as often as that position was compatible with the necessity they were under of getting on for they evidently understood that they were guided by a firm hand edward was delighted with their behavior
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3186.mp3	and for the first time i saw his father smile on him these are fine brutes he said not taking his eyes from them but they are not equal to my mare nell alice is afraid of her but i hope that you cassandra
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3187.mp3	leaping so high that the harness seemed rattling from their backs he struck them and said go on now go on devils there was no further trouble he encouraged mother not to be afraid looking keenly at me

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3189.mp3	as an old college friend locke morgeson sounded familiarly he said a member of his mother's family named somers had married a gentleman of that name he remembered it from an old ivory miniature which his mother had shown him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3190.mp3	telling him it was the likeness of her cousin rachel's husband i replied we knew that grandfather had married a rachel somers cousin charles was surprised and a little vexed that the doctor had never told him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3191.mp3	and we followed him to her school room i was at once interested and impressed by the appearance of my teacher that was to be she was a dignified kind looking woman who asked me a few questions in such a pleasant direct manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3192.mp3	that i frankly told her i was eighteen years old very ignorant and averse from learning but i did not speak loud enough for anybody beside herself to hear now said mother when we came away

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3201.mp3	kept from myself during this interval the matter is often subservient to the manner arthur's feelings were played upon also he wept often confiding to me his grief and his plans for the future
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3202.mp3	things would go well he said for everybody must expect to die then the bible says so he informed me also that he expected to be an architect and that mother liked it he had an idea

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3204.mp3	for meals were prepared at all hours for comers and goers temperance told me that the mild and indifferent mourners were fond of good victuals and she thought their hearts were lighter than their stomachs when they went away

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3207.mp3	for she had never worn out the garments made for grand'ther warren she's a bigger child than ever temperance remarked and must have her way

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3216.mp3	i think we might kiss each other now she said i opened my arms holding her against my breast so tightly that she drew back but kissed my cheek gently and took from her pocket

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3220.mp3	they seemed to fall on the coffin in dull strife with its inmate who mutely contradicted them a discourse followed which was calculated to harrow the feelings to the utmost arthur began to cry so nervously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3221.mp3	that some considerate friend took him out and aunt merce wept so violently that she grew faint and caught hold of me i gave her the flacon of salts which revived her but i felt as father looked stern
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3222.mp3	and anxious to escape the unprofitable trial as the coffin was taken out to the hearse my heart twisted and palpitated as if a command had been laid upon it to follow and not leave her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3223.mp3	when the hearse moved down the street father arthur and i were called and assisted in our own chaise as if we were helpless the reins were put in father's hands and the horse was led behind the hearse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3224.mp3	at last the word was given and the long procession began to move through the street which was deserted a cat ran out of a house and scampered across the way arthur laughed and father jumped nervously at the sound of his laugh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3225.mp3	the graveyard was a mile outside the village a sandy plain where a few stunted pines transplanted from the woods near it struggled to keep alive as we turned from the street into the lane which led to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3226.mp3	and rode up a little hill where the sand was so deep that it muffled the wheels and feet of the horses the whole round of the gray sky was visible it hung low over us i wished it to drop and blot out the vague nothings under it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3227.mp3	we left the carriage at the palings and walked up the narrow path among the mounds where every stone was marked morgeson some so old that they were stained with blotches of yellow moss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3228.mp3	slanting backward and forward in protest against the folly of indicating what was no longer beneath them the mounds were covered with mats of scanty tangled grass with here and there a rank spot of green
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3229.mp3	it was the custom and father took his hat off to thank his friends for their sympathy and attention his lips moved but no words were audible the procession moved down the path again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3230.mp3	arthur's hand was in mine he stamped his feet firmly on the sand as if to break the oppressive silence which no one seemed disposed to disturb the same ceremonies were performed in starting us homeward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3231.mp3	but not a soul was there when we went in the duties of friendship and tradition had been fulfilled the neighbors had gone home to their avocations for the public the tragedy was over all speculation on the degree of our grief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3232.mp3	or our indifference was settled we could take off our mourning garments and our mourning countenance now that we were alone or we could give way to that anguish we are afraid and ashamed to show except before the one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3233.mp3	the evening passed on madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced on his wife's request m de villefort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3234.mp3	was the first to give the signal of departure he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3235.mp3	as for m danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3236.mp3	he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3237.mp3	without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel chateau renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m de villefort's carriage danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3238.mp3	had offered him a seat in his carriage andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3239.mp3	was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3240.mp3	amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king's attorney then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3241.mp3	and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3242.mp3	he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major's little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3243.mp3	then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his forty eight thousand francs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3244.mp3	were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker's servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon one thing above all the rest heightened the respect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3245.mp3	nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3246.mp3	by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught then he had eaten some without saying a word more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3247.mp3	danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3248.mp3	by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3249.mp3	to morrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3250.mp3	if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3251.mp3	and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3252.mp3	who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son sixty thousand francs a year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3253.mp3	as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3254.mp3	giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3255.mp3	who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step at that moment a hand touched his shoulder the young man turned round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3256.mp3	and had returned just as they were starting but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3257.mp3	and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf's or jackal's a red handkerchief encircled his gray head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3258.mp3	torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man's shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3259.mp3	and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3260.mp3	or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3261.mp3	he asked pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you you have no right to beg at night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3262.mp3	said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3263.mp3	i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3264.mp3	speak quickly friend the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3265.mp3	i can scarcely stand the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity tell me he said tell me what you want well then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3266.mp3	i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back andrea turned pale but said nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3267.mp3	yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3268.mp3	at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3269.mp3	there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea oh as for that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3270.mp3	i'll take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horse's bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for any one to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3271.mp3	don't think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no it's only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3272.mp3	come step in said the young man it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3273.mp3	andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3274.mp3	andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3275.mp3	let me ask you why you deceived me how have i deceived you how do you ask
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3276.mp3	but instead of that you come to paris how does that annoy you it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose so said andrea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3277.mp3	you are speculating upon me what fine words he uses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3278.mp3	that you are mistaken well well don't be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3279.mp3	i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own you know i always did call you my child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3280.mp3	come come what then patience patience i am patient but go on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3281.mp3	you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker so that as you confess you are jealous no i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3282.mp3	i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3283.mp3	you speak to me before my servant how can i help that my boy i speak to you when i can catch you you have a quick horse a light tilbury
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3284.mp3	you are naturally as slippery as an eel if i had missed you to night i might not have had another chance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3285.mp3	you are lucky i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3286.mp3	with his unpleasant smile it was very polite of you come said andrea what do you want you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3287.mp3	that is not right take care or i may become troublesome this menace smothered the young man's passion he urged the horse again into a trot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3288.mp3	as you said just now you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3289.mp3	i am young and wilful between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged is it my fault if fortune
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3290.mp3	has been kind to me fortune has been kind to you then your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3291.mp3	his eyes sparkling with avarice oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3292.mp3	rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet you would not have known me you wrong me my boy now i have found you nothing prevents my being as well dressed as any one knowing as i do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3293.mp3	the goodness of your heart if you have two coats you will give me one of them i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry true said andrea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3294.mp3	what an appetite you used to have is it as good now oh yes replied andrea laughing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3295.mp3	he is not a prince simply a count a count and a rich one too eh yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3296.mp3	oh be easy i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3297.mp3	you must pay for it you understand well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3298.mp3	i think that with a hundred francs a month well i could live upon a hundred francs come you understand me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3299.mp3	but that with with with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy here are two hundred said andrea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3300.mp3	there now again you degrade me how so by making me apply to the servants when i want to transact business with you alone well be it so then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3301.mp3	take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be paid yours come come i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3302.mp3	but tell me all about it why do you wish to know asked cavalcanti what do you again defy me no the fact is i have found my father what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3303.mp3	a real father yes so long as he pays me you'll honor and believe him that's right what is his name major cavalcanti
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3304.mp3	so far i have appeared to answer his purpose and who found this father for you the count of monte cristo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3305.mp3	the man whose house you have just left yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3306.mp3	since he holds the money chest well i will mention you to him meanwhile what are you going to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3307.mp3	yes you it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions ah true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3308.mp3	well i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a cafe then in the evening i shall go to the theatre
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3309.mp3	i shall look like some retired baker that is what i want come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3310.mp3	do you think so m bossuet and you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3311.mp3	a peer of france ah said andrea who knows major cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3312.mp3	and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3313.mp3	how not at all why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3314.mp3	what was there before making in all about two hundred francs why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3315.mp3	this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean then i should become simply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3316.mp3	and good by to my dream of resembling the retired baker no no my boy i prefer remaining honorably in the capital andrea scowled certainly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3317.mp3	as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3318.mp3	where it began playing with a pistol but meanwhile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3319.mp3	who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3320.mp3	the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another andrea's hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red mustache which it played with for some time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3321.mp3	he said how happy you will be i will do my best said the inn keeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife well then we will go into paris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3322.mp3	but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion it seems to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3323.mp3	we shall see he then took the great coat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off cavalcanti's hat which he placed upon his own head and finally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3324.mp3	he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself but tell me said andrea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3325.mp3	it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off come come enough of this said cavalcanti
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3326.mp3	i hope i am not the cause hush said andrea they passed the barrier without accident at the first cross street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3327.mp3	well said andrea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3328.mp3	you would not like me to risk taking cold but what am i to do you oh you are young while i am beginning to get old au revoir benedetto
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3329.mp3	and running into a court he disappeared alas said andrea sighing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3330.mp3	we have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of mankind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement as they range lower and lower in development
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3331.mp3	that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them though this is not true universally for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3332.mp3	as upon the degree in which they possess certain special requisites requisites however so closely connected with their degree of general advancement that any variation between the two is rather the exception than the rule
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3333.mp3	that they should be willing and able to fulfill the duties and discharge the functions which it imposes on them the willingness of the people to accept representative government only becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler or a foreign nation or nations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3334.mp3	who have gained power over the country are disposed to offer it the boon to individual reformers the question is almost irrelevant since if no other objection can be made to their enterprise than that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3335.mp3	they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end they aim at when opinion is really adverse its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to representative government in itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3336.mp3	the contrary case is not indeed unexampled there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3337.mp3	whether monarchical or popular in any case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at all likely to be made indifference to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3338.mp3	rather than positive opposition are the obstacles to be expected these however are as fatal and may be as hard to be got rid of as actual aversion it being easier in most cases to change the direction of an active feeling than to create one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3339.mp3	in a state previously passive when a people have no sufficient value for and attachment to a representative constitution they have next to no chance of retaining it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3340.mp3	and is in direct contact with the public to it principally the hopes and fears of individuals are directed and by it both the benefits and the terrors and prestige of government are mainly represented to the public eye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3341.mp3	unless therefore the authorities whose office it is to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country the executive has always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3342.mp3	and is sure to be well supported in doing so representative institutions necessarily depend for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in case of their being endangered if too little valued for this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3343.mp3	they seldom obtain a footing at all and if they do are almost sure to be overthrown as soon as the head of the government or any party leader who can muster force for a coup de main is willing to run some small risk for absolute power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3344.mp3	these considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a representative government the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3453.mp3	it hath reached me o auspicious king that quoth the beggar to the woman give me an alms however small but she answered him how can i give thee aught when the king cutteth off the hands of all who give alms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3454.mp3	then he said i conjure thee by allah almighty give me an alms so when he adjured her by the holy name of allah she had ruth on him and gave him two scones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3455.mp3	the king heard of this whereupon he called her before him and cut off her hands after which she returned to her house now it chanced after a while that the king said to his mother i have a mind to take a wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3456.mp3	so do thou marry me to a fair woman quoth she there is among our female slaves one who is unsurpassed in beauty but she hath a grievous blemish the king asked what is that and his mother answered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3457.mp3	she hath had both her hands cut off said he let me see her so she brought her to him and he was ravished by her and married her and went in unto her and begat upon her a son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3458.mp3	now this was the woman who had given two scones as an alms to the asker and whose hands had been cut off therefor and when the king married her her fellow wives envied her and wrote to the common husband that she was an unchaste
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3459.mp3	having just given birth to the boy so he wrote to his mother bidding her carry the woman into the desert and leave her there the old queen obeyed his commandment and abandoned the woman and her son in the desert
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3460.mp3	whereupon she fell to weeping for that which had befallen her and wailing with exceeding sore wail as she went along she came to a river and knelt down to drink being overcome with excess of thirst
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3461.mp3	for fatigue of walking and for grief but as she bent her head the child which was at her neck fell into the water then she sat weeping bitter tears for her child and as she wept behold came up two men who said to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3462.mp3	what maketh thee weep quoth she i had a child at my neck and he hath fallen into the water they asked wilt thou that we bring him out to thee and she answered yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3463.mp3	so they prayed to almighty allah and the child came forth of the water to her safe and sound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3464.mp3	yes replied she whereupon they prayed to allah extolled and exalted be he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3465.mp3	and with the profit he laid in daily bread for his household one morning he went out and sold the day's yarn as wont when there met him one of his brethren who complained to him of need so he gave him the price of the thread and returned empty handed to his family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3466.mp3	who said to him where is the cotton and the food quoth he such an one met me and complained to me of want whereupon i gave him the price of the yarn and they said how shall we do we have nothing to sell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3467.mp3	so he took them to the bazar but none would buy them of him however presently as he stood in the market there passed by a man with a fish and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3468.mp3	and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the three hundred and forty ninth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3469.mp3	that the man took the trencher and jar to the bazar but none would buy them of him however there presently passed by a man with a fish which was so stinking and so swollen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3470.mp3	and he said to the jew wilt thou sell me thine unsaleable ware for mine yes answered the jew and giving him the wooden trencher and jar took the fish and carried it home to his family who said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3471.mp3	what shall we do with this fish quoth he we will broil it and eat it till it please allah to provide bread for us so they took it and ripping open its belly found therein a great pearl and told the head of the household who said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3472.mp3	see ye if it be pierced if so it belongeth to some one of the folk if not tis a provision of allah for us so they examined it and found it unpierced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3473.mp3	now when it was the morrow the jew carried it to one of his brethren which was an expert in jewels and the man asked o such an one whence haddest thou this pearl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3474.mp3	it was a gift of almighty allah to us and the other said it is worth a thousand dirhams and i will give thee that but take it to such an one for he hath more money and skill than i so the jew took it to the jeweller who said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3475.mp3	it is worth seventy thousand dirhams and no more then he paid him that sum and the jew hired two porters to carry the money to his house as he came to his door a beggar accosted him saying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3476.mp3	quoth the jew to the asker but yesterday we were even as thou take thee half this money so he made two parts of it and each took his half
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3477.mp3	the baker and other tradesmen dunned and importuned me and my misery became extreme for i knew of no resource nor what to do things being on this wise there came to me one day certain of my servants and said to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3478.mp3	at the door is a pilgrim wight who seeketh admission to thee quoth i admit him so he came in and behold he was a khorasani we exchanged salutations and he said to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3479.mp3	tell me art thou abu hassan al ziyadi and i replied yes what is thy wish quoth he i am a stranger and am minded to make the pilgrimage but i have with me a great sum of money which is burdensome to bear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3480.mp3	so i wish to deposit these ten thousand dirhams with thee whilst i make my pilgrimage and return if the caravan march back and thou see me not then know that i am dead in which case the money is a gift from me to thee but if i come back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3481.mp3	it shall be mine i answered be it as thou wilt an thus please allah almighty so he brought out a leather bag and i said to the servant fetch the scales
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3482.mp3	and when he brought them the man weighed out the money and handed it to me after which he went his way then i called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3483.mp3	and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the three hundred and fiftieth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3484.mp3	that quoth abu hassan al ziyadi i called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities and spent freely and amply saying to myself by the time he returns allah will have relieved me with one or other of the bounties he hath by him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3485.mp3	however on the very next day the servant came in to me and said thy friend the khorasan man is at the door admit him answered i so he came in and said to me i had purposed to make the pilgrimage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3486.mp3	and i have resolved to return so give me the monies i deposited with thee yesterday when i heard this i was troubled and perplexed beyond measure of perplexity known to man and wotted not what reply to make him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3487.mp3	for if i denied it he would put me on my oath and i should be disgraced in the world to come whilst if i told him that i had spent the money he would make an outcry and dishonour me before men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3488.mp3	so i said to him allah give thee health
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3489.mp3	so i rose and bade the boy saddle me the she mule answered he o my lord it is yet but the first third of the night and indeed we have hardly had time to rest i returned to my bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3490.mp3	but sleep was forbidden to me and i ceased not to awaken the boy and he to put me off till break of day when he saddled me the mule and i mounted and rode out not knowing whither to go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3491.mp3	whilst she fared on with me to the eastward of baghdad presently as i went along behold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3492.mp3	expound to me thy case so i recounted to him my case and he wept sore and said to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3493.mp3	woe to thee succour abu hassan al ziyadi i awoke a second time but knowing thee not i went to sleep again and he came to me a third time and still i knew thee not and went to sleep again then he came to me once more and said out on thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3494.mp3	succour abu hassan al ziyadi after that i dared not sleep any more but watched the rest of the night and aroused my people and sent them on all sides in quest of thee then he gave me one myriad of dirhams saying this is for the khorasani
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3495.mp3	and other ten thousand saying spend freely of this and amend thy case therewith and set thine affairs in order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3496.mp3	and behold presently came the khorasani so i carried him into the house and brought out to him one myriad of dirhams saying here is thy money quoth he it is not my very money how cometh this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3497.mp3	so i told him the whole story and he wept and said by allah haddest thou told me the fact at first i had not pressed thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3498.mp3	five years is but a short time in the life of a man and yet many things may happen therein for instance the whole way of a family's life may be changed good natures may be made into bad ones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3499.mp3	and out of a soul of faith grow a spirit of unbelief the independence of respectability may harden into the insolence of defiance and the sensitive cheek of modesty into the brazen face of shamelessness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3500.mp3	it may be true that the habits of years are hard to change but this is not true of the first sixteen or seventeen years of a young person's life else kitty hamilton and joe could not so easily have become what they were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3501.mp3	it had taken barely five years to accomplish an entire metamorphosis of their characters in joe's case even a shorter time was needed he was so ready to go down that it needed but a gentle push to start him and once started
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3502.mp3	there was nothing within him to hold him back from the depths for his will was as flabby as his conscience and his pride which stands to some men for conscience had no definite aim or direction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3503.mp3	hattie sterling had given him both his greatest impulse for evil and for good she had at first given him his gentle push but when she saw that his collapse would lose her a faithful and useful slave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3504.mp3	she had sought to check his course her threat of the severance of their relations had held him up for a little time and she began to believe that he was safe again he went back to the work he had neglected drank moderately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3505.mp3	and acted in most things as a sound sensible being then all of a sudden he went down again and went down badly she kept her promise and threw him over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3506.mp3	then he became a hanger on at the clubs a genteel loafer he used to say in his sober moments that at last he was one of the boys that sadness had spoken of he did not work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3507.mp3	but he soon tired of being separated from hattie and straightened up again after some demur she received him upon his former footing it was only for a few months he fell again for almost four years this had happened intermittently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3508.mp3	finally he took a turn for the better that endured so long that hattie sterling again gave him her faith then the woman made her mistake she warmed to him she showed him that she was proud of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3509.mp3	he went forth at once to celebrate his victory he did not return to her for three days then he was battered unkempt and thick of speech she looked at him in silent contempt for a while as he sat nursing his aching head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3510.mp3	she said finally with cutting scorn you ought to be put under a glass case and placed on exhibition he groaned and his head sunk lower a drunken man is always disarmed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3511.mp3	his helplessness instead of inspiring her with pity inflamed her with an unfeeling anger that burst forth in a volume of taunts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3512.mp3	no one had ever looked at you until i picked you up and you ve been strutting around ever since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3513.mp3	and now this is the way you pay me back drunk half the time and half drunk the rest well you know what i told you the last time you got loaded i mean it too you re not the only star in sight see she laughed meanly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3514.mp3	and began to sing you ll have to find another baby now for the first time he looked up and his eyes were full of tears tears both of grief and intoxication there was an expression of a whipped dog on his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3515.mp3	he pleaded stretching out his hands to her her eyes blazed back at him but she sang on insolently tauntingly the very inanity of the man disgusted her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3516.mp3	and on a sudden impulse she sprang up and struck him full in the face with the flat of her hand he was too weak to resist the blow and tumbling from the chair fell limply to the floor where he lay at her feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3517.mp3	alternately weeping aloud and quivering with drunken hiccoughing sobs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3518.mp3	you sha'n't lay around my house he had already begun to fall into a drunken sleep but she shook him got him to his feet and pushed him outside the door now go you drunken dog
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3519.mp3	and never put your foot inside this house again he stood outside swaying dizzily upon his feet and looking back with dazed eyes at the door then he muttered pu me out wi you pu me out damn you well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3520.mp3	and he half walked half fell down the street sadness and skaggsy were together at the club that night five years had not changed the latter as to wealth or position or inclination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3521.mp3	and he was still a frequent visitor at the banner he always came in alone now for maudie had gone the way of all the half world and reached depths to which mister skaggs's job prevented him from following her however
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3522.mp3	he mourned truly for his lost companion and to night he was in a particularly pensive mood some one was playing rag time on the piano and the dancers were wheeling in time to the music
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3523.mp3	skaggsy looked at them regretfully as he sipped his liquor it made him think of maudie he sighed and turned away i tell you sadness he said impulsively dancing is the poetry of motion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3524.mp3	yes replied sadness and dancing in rag time is the dialect poetry the reporter did not like this it savoured of flippancy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3525.mp3	and he was about entering upon a discussion to prove that sadness had no soul when joe with blood shot eyes and dishevelled clothes staggered in and reeled towards them drunk again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3526.mp3	said sadness really it s a waste of time for joe to sober up hullo there as the young man brought up against him take a seat he put him in a chair at the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3527.mp3	oh a hair of the dog some men shave their dogs clean and then have hydrophobia here jack they drank and then as if the whiskey had done him good joe sat up in his chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3528.mp3	lucky dog you might have known it would have happened sooner or later better sooner than never skaggs smoked in silence and looked at joe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3529.mp3	then bracing himself up again he broke out suddenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3530.mp3	he never stole that money know he di n he threatened to fall asleep now but the reporter was all alert he scented a story by jove he exclaimed did you hear that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3531.mp3	come come wake up here three more jack what about your father father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3532.mp3	here here tell us about your father and the money if he did n't steal it who did who did tha s it who did ol man di n steal it know he di n oh let him alone skaggsy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3533.mp3	yes he does a drunken man tells the truth in some cases said sadness oh let me alone man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3534.mp3	and if this story is one i m a made man the drink seemed to revive the young man again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3535.mp3	at its close he relapsed into stupidity murmuring she throwed me down well sneered sadness you see drunken men tell the truth and you don't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3536.mp3	you re disappointed are n't you i confess i am disappointed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3537.mp3	oh you have well don't handle it carelessly it might go off and sadness rose the reporter sat thinking for a time and then followed him leaving joe in a drunken sleep at the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3538.mp3	there he lay for more than two hours when he finally awoke he started up as if some determination had come to him in his sleep a part of the helplessness of his intoxication had gone but his first act was to call for more whiskey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3539.mp3	this he gulped down and followed with another and another for a while he stood still brooding silently his red eyes blinking at the light then he turned abruptly and left the club
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3540.mp3	it was very late when he reached hattie's door but he opened it with his latch key as he had been used to do he stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy as he had so often done before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3541.mp3	then he went directly to her room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3542.mp3	his voice was steadier now but grim what do you want
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3543.mp3	get out or i ll have you taken out she sprang up in bed glaring angrily at him his hands twitched nervously as if her will were conquering him and he were uneasy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3544.mp3	he said yes and i m going to do it again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3545.mp3	she started to rise but he took a step towards her and she paused he looked as she had never seen him look before his face was ashen and his eyes like fire and blood she quailed beneath the look
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3546.mp3	he took another step towards her you put me out to night he repeated like a dog his step was steady and his tone was clear menacingly clear she shrank back from him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3547.mp3	back to the wall still his hands twitched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3548.mp3	still he crept slowly towards her his lips working and his hands moving convulsively joe joe she said hoarsely what s the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3549.mp3	the gown had fallen away from her breast and showed the convulsive fluttering of her heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3550.mp3	and his hands sought each other while the fingers twitched over one another like coiling serpents you put me out you you and you made me what i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3551.mp3	the realisation of what he was of his foulness and degradation seemed just to have come to him fully you made me what i am and then you sent me away you let me come back and now you put me out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3552.mp3	she gazed at him fascinated she tried to scream and she could not this was not joe this was not the boy that she had turned and twisted about her little finger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3553.mp3	this was a terrible terrible man or a monster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3554.mp3	for an instant she lost their steady glare and then she found her voice the scream was checked as it began his fingers had closed over her throat just where the gown had left it temptingly bare they gave it the caress of death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3555.mp3	she struggled they held her her eyes prayed to his but his were the fire of hell she fell back upon her pillow in silence he had not uttered a word he held her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3556.mp3	finally he flung her from him like a rag and sank into a chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3557.mp3	she had sought the door of paradise and the door of hell had been opened to her if the frightful idea which she did not doubt had already suggested itself to leopold should now be encouraged there was nothing but black madness before her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3558.mp3	her poldie on the scaffold god in heaven infinitely rather would she poison herself and him then she remembered how pleased and consoled he had been when she said something about their dying together and that reassured her a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3559.mp3	but she must take care that foolish extravagant curate should not come near him there was no knowing to what he might persuade him poor poldie was so easily led by any show of nobility anything that looked grand or self sacrificing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3560.mp3	helen's only knowledge of guilt came from the pale image of it lifted above her horizon by the refraction of her sympathy she did not know perhaps never would understand the ghastly horror of conscious guilt besides which there is no evil else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3561.mp3	agonies of injury a man may endure and so far from being overwhelmed rise above them tenfold a man who were he to awake to the self knowledge of a crime would sink into a heap of ruin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3562.mp3	then indeed if there be no god or one that has not an infinite power of setting right that which has gone wrong with his work then indeed welcome the faith for faith it may then be called of such as say there is no hereafter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3563.mp3	helen did not know to what gulfs of personal shame nay to what summits of public execration a man may be glad to flee for refuge from the fangs of home born guilt if so be there is any refuge to be found in either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3564.mp3	and some kind of refuge there does seem to be strange it is and true that in publicity itself lies some relief from the gnawing of the worm as if even a cursing humanity were a barrier of protection between the torn soul and its crime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3565.mp3	it flees to its kind for shelter from itself hence i imagine in part may the coolness of some criminals be accounted for their quietness is the relief brought by confession even confession but to their fellows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3566.mp3	is it that the crime seems then lifted a little from their shoulders and its weight shared by the ace helen had hoped that the man who had spoken in public so tenderly and at the same time so powerfully of the saving heart of the universe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3567.mp3	that would have no divisions of pride no scatterings of hate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3568.mp3	which she might have carried home in gladness to her sick souled brother to comfort and strengthen him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3569.mp3	and make him feel that after all there was yet a place for him in the universe and that he was no outcast of gehenna but instead of such words of gentle might like those of the man of whom he was so fond of talking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3570.mp3	he had only spoken drearily of duty hinting at a horror that would plunge the whole ancient family into a hell of dishonour and contempt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3571.mp3	skeletons they were and no human beings at all her father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3572.mp3	if leopold had had her mother for his too instead of the dark skinned woman with the flashing eyes he would never have brought this upon them it was all his mother's fault the fault of her race and of the horrible drug her people had taught him to take
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3573.mp3	and was he to go and confess it and be tried for it and be great god and here was the priest actually counselling what was worse than any suicide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3574.mp3	suddenly however it occurred to her that the curate had had no knowledge of the facts of the case and had therefore been compelled to talk at random it was impossible he should suspect the crime of which her brother had been guilty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3575.mp3	and therefore could not know the frightful consequences of such a confession as he had counselled had she not better then tell him all and so gather from him some right and reasonable advice for the soothing of the agonies of her poor broken winged angel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3576.mp3	but alas what security had she that a man capable of such priestly seveirity and heartlessness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3577.mp3	no she would venture no farther sooner would she go to george bascombe from whom she not only could look for no spiritual comfort but whose theories were so cruel against culprits of all sorts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3578.mp3	alas alas she was alone absolutely alone in the great waste death eyed universe but for a man to talk so of the tenderness of jesus christ
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3579.mp3	and then serve her as the curate had done it was indeed shameless he would never have treated a poor wretched woman like that and as she said thus to herself again the words sounded in the ear of her heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3580.mp3	come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest whence came the voice from her memory or from that inner chamber of the spirit which the one spirit bearing spirit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3581.mp3	keeps for his own in every house that he builds alas so long in most human houses shut away from the rest of the rooms and forgotten or recollected with uneasiness as a lumber closet in which lie too many things that had better not be looked into
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3582.mp3	but what matter where the voice that had said them so long as the words were true and she might believe them whatever is true can be believed of the true heart ere she knew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3583.mp3	helen was on her knees with her head on the chair yet once more crying to the hearer of cries possible or impossible being she knew not in the least but words reported of him had given birth to the cry to help her in her dire need
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3584.mp3	instead of any word or thought even coming to her that might be fancied an answer she was scared from her knees by an approaching step
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3585.mp3	helen rose and hastened to her brother with a heart of lead in her body she started when she saw him some change had passed on him since the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3586.mp3	that glimmer on his countenance doubtful as the first of the morning when the traveller knows not whether the light be in the sky or only in his brain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3587.mp3	but at the same time he appeared more wasted and pinched and death like than she had yet seen him or was it only in her eyes was she but reading in his face the agony she had herself gone through that day helen helen he cried as she entered the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3588.mp3	what was that poldie asked helen with a pang of fear why those words of course what else you sang them to me afterwards you know helen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3589.mp3	don't you think he might be able to do something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3590.mp3	was this what came of praying she thought bitterly something or other i don't know what exactly returned leopold oh helen he broke out with a cry stifled by the caution that had grown habitual to both of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3591.mp3	is there no help of any kind anywhere surely mister wingfold could tell me something comfort me somehow if i were to tell him all about it i could trust the man that said such things as those you told me that i could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3592.mp3	oh i wish i hadn't run away but had let them take me and hang me helen felt herself grow white she turned away and pretended to search for something she had dropped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3593.mp3	i don't think he would be of the slightest use to you she said still stooping and she felt like a devil dragging the soul of her brother to hell but that was a foolish fancy and must be resisted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3594.mp3	not if i told him everything leopold hissed from between his teeth in the struggle to keep down a shriek no not if you told him everything she answered and felt like a judge condemning him to death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3595.mp3	what is he there for then said leopold indignantly and turned his face to the wall and moaned helen had not yet thought of asking herself whether her love to her brother was all clear love and nowise mingled with selfishness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3596.mp3	whether in the fresh horror that day poured into the cup that had seemed already running over it was of her brother only she thought or whether threatened shame to herself had not a part in her misery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3597.mp3	for what attempt even had he made to comfort her what had he done but utter common places and truisms about duty and who could tell but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3598.mp3	indeed was she not certain that such a man bringing the artillery of his fanaticism to bear upon her poor boy's wild enthusiastic temperament would speedily persuade him to make a reality of that terrible thing he had already thought of that hideously impossible possibility
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3599.mp3	it could not have been long she thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3600.mp3	apparently senseless on the pillow and she thought he was dead the same moment she was free the horror had departed from her own atmosphere too and she made haste to restore him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3601.mp3	but in all she did for him she felt like the executioner who gives restoratives to the wretch that has fainted on the rack or the wheel what right had she she thought to multiply to him his moments of torture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3602.mp3	if the cruel power that had created him for such misery whoever whatever wherever he might be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3603.mp3	yet she hesitated not a single moment in her ministrations there is so much passes in us of which our consciousness takes no grasp or but with such a flitting touch as scarcely to hand it over to the memory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3604.mp3	that i feel encouraged to doubt whether ever there was a man absolutely without hope that there have been alas are many who are aware of no ground of hope nay even who feel no glimmer in them of anything they can call hope i know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3605.mp3	but i think in them all is an underlying unconscious hope i think that not one in all the world has more than a shadowy notion of what hopelessness means perhaps utter hopelessness is the outer darkness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3606.mp3	at length leopold opened his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3607.mp3	nonsense dear poldie it was all fancy nothing more she returned in a voice almost as hollow as his and the lightness of the words uttered in such a tone jarred dismayfully on her own ear fancy he repeated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3608.mp3	i know what fancy is as well as any man or woman born that was no fancy she stood there by the wardrobe in the same dress her face as white as her dress and listen i will tell you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3609.mp3	i will soon satisfy you it could be no fancy here he pushed her from him and looked straight in her eyes i saw her back reflected in the mirror of the wardrobe door and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3610.mp3	here the fixed look of horror threatened to return upon his face but he went on listen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3611.mp3	ugh i saw it in the mirror his voice had risen to a strangled shriek his face was distorted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3612.mp3	if indeed that be a possible source of courage and it is not gathered rather from the hidden hope of which i speak and the love that will cleave and not forsake she set her teeth and said let her come then poldie i am with you and i defy her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3613.mp3	she shall know that a sister's love is stronger than the hate of a jilt even if you did kill her before god poldie i would after all rather be you than she say what you will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3614.mp3	but leopold seemed not to hear a word she said and lay with his face to the wall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3615.mp3	as wingfold came out of the room which was near the stair helen rose from the top of it where she had been sitting all the time he had been with her brother he closed the door gently behind him and stepped softly along the landing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3616.mp3	a human soul in guilt and agony is an awful presence but there was more than that in the hush of the curate he felt as if he had left the physician of souls behind him at the bedside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3617.mp3	but at his head stood one who watched his throes with the throbs of such a human heart as never beat in any bosom but his own and the executioners were angels of light no wonder if with such a feeling in his breast wingfold walked softly and his face glistened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3618.mp3	he was not aware that the tears stood in his eyes but helen saw them you know all she faltered i do will you let me out by the garden again i wish to be alone she led the way down the stair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3619.mp3	and walked with him through the garden wingfold did not speak you don't think very badly of my poor brother do you mister wingfold said helen meekly it is a terrible fate he returned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3620.mp3	i think i never saw a lovelier disposition i do hope his mind will soon be more composed i think he knows where alone he can find rest i am well aware how foolish that of which i speak seems to some minds miss lingard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3621.mp3	but when a man is once overwhelmed in his own deeds when they have turned into spectres to mock at him when he loathes himself and turns with sickness from past present and future i know but one choice left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3622.mp3	into the life i hope your brother will enter i am so glad you don't hate him hate him who but a demon could hate him helen lifted a grateful look from eyes that swam in tears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3623.mp3	the terror of his possible counsel for the moment vanished he could never tell him to give himself up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3624.mp3	the dwarf exclaimed helen shuddering at the remembrance of what she had gone through at the cottage yes that man's soul is as grand and beautiful and patient as his body is insignificant and distorted and troubled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3625.mp3	he is the wisest and best man i have ever known i must ask leopold returned helen who the better the man was represented felt the more jealous and fearful of the advice he might give
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3626.mp3	her love and her conscience were not yet at one with each other they parted at the door from the garden and she returned to the sick room she paused hesitating to enter all was still as the grave she turned the handle softly and peeped in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3627.mp3	could it be that wingfold's bearing had communicated to her mind a shadow of the awe with which he had left the place where perhaps a soul was being born again leopold did not move terror laid hold of her heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3628.mp3	she stepped quickly in and round the screen to the side of the bed there to her glad surprise he lay fast asleep with the tears not yet dried upon his face her heart swelled with some sense unknown before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3629.mp3	was it rudimentary thankfulness to the father of her spirit as she stood gazing with the look of a mother over her sick child he lifted his eyelids and smiled a sad smile when did you come into the room he said a minute ago she answered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3630.mp3	i did not hear you he returned no you were asleep not i mister wingfold is only just gone i have let him out on the meadow since leopold stared looked half alarmed and then said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3631.mp3	did god make me sleep helen she did not answer the light of a new hope in his eye as if the dawn had begun at last to break over the dark mountains was already reflected from her heart oh helen he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3632.mp3	that is a good fellow such a good fellow a pang of jealousy the first she had ever felt shot to her heart she had hitherto since his trouble been all in all to her leopold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3633.mp3	had the curate been a man she liked she would not perhaps have minded it so much you will be able to do without me now she said sadly i never could understand taking to people at first sight some people are made so i suppose helen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3634.mp3	i know i took to you at first sight i shall never forget the first time i saw you when i came to this country a lonely little foreigner and you a great beautiful lady for such you seemed to me though you have told me since you were only a great gawky girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3635.mp3	i know that could never have been you ran to meet me and took me in your arms and kissed me i was as if i had crossed the sea of death and found paradise in your bosom i am not likely to forget you for mister wingfold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3636.mp3	good and kind and strong as he is even she could not make me forget you helen but neither you nor i can do without mister wingfold any more i fancy i wish you liked him better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3637.mp3	but you will in time you see he's not one to pay young ladies compliments as i have heard some parsons do and he may be a little no not unpolished not that that's not what i mean but unornamental in his manners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3638.mp3	you know all about him though you never saw him before that is true returned leopold but then he came to me with his door open and let me walk in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3639.mp3	he hasn't got a secret like us helen he added sadly what did he say to you much what he said to you from the pulpit the other day i should think then she was right for all his hardness and want of sympathy the curate had yet had regard to her entreaties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3640.mp3	and was not going to put any horrid notions about duty and self sacrifice into the poor boy's head he's coming again to morrow added leopold almost gleefully and then perhaps he will tell me more and help me on a bit did he tell you he wants to bring a friend with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3641.mp3	no i can't see the good of taking more people into our confidence why should he not do what he thinks best helen you don't interfere with the doctor why should you with him when a man is going to the bottom as fast as he can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3642.mp3	and another comes diving after him it isn't for me to say how he is to take hold of me no helen when i trust i trust out and out helen sighed thinking how ill that had worked with emmeline
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3643.mp3	it was some moments before either of them spoke and it did not help wingfold that she sat clouded by a dark coloured veil at length he said you must not fear to trust me because i doubt my ability to help you i can at least assure you of my sympathy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3644.mp3	can you tell me she said from behind more veils than that of lace how to get rid of a haunting idea that depends on the nature of the idea i should imagine answered the curate such things sometimes arise merely from the state of the health
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3645.mp3	and there the doctor is the best help helen shook her head and smiled behind her veil a grievous smile the curate paused but receiving no assistance ventured on again if it be a thought of something past and gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3646.mp3	for which nothing can be done i think activity in one's daily work must be the best aid to endurance oh dear oh dear sighed helen when one has no heart to endure and hates the very sunlight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3647.mp3	you wouldn't talk about work to a man dying of hunger would you i'm not sure about that he wouldn't heed you perhaps not what would you do then give him some food and try him again i think
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3648.mp3	then give me some food some hope i mean and try me again without that i don't care about duty or life or anything tell me then what is the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3649.mp3	i may be able to hint at some hope said wingfold very gently do you call yourself a christian the question would to most people have sounded strange abrupt inquisitorial but to helen it sounded not one of them all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3650.mp3	no she answered ah said the curate a little sadly and went on because then i could have said you know where to go for comfort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3651.mp3	might it not be well however to try if there is any to be had from him that said come unto me and i will give you rest i can do nothing with that i have tried and tried to pray but it is of no use
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3652.mp3	i suppose it is because i cannot believe there is anyone hearing a word i say yesterday when i got alone in the park i prayed aloud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3653.mp3	i thought that perhaps even if he might not be able to read what was in my heart he might be able to hear my voice i was even foolish enough to wish i knew greek because perhaps he would understand me better if i were to pray in greek
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3654.mp3	she tried hard but could not prevent a sob
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3655.mp3	will you not tell me something about it said the curate yet more gently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3656.mp3	his help may be on the way to you or even with you only you do not recognize it for what it is i have known that kind of thing tell me some fact or some feeling i can lay hold of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3657.mp3	possibly there is something you ought to do and are not doing and that is why you cannot rest i think jesus would give no rest except in the way of learning of him helen's sobs ceased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3658.mp3	but what appeared to the curate a long silence followed at length she said with faltering voice suppose it were a great wrong that had been done and that was the unendurable thought suppose i say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3659.mp3	that was what made me miserable then you must of course make all possible reparation answered wingfold at once but if none were possible what then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3660.mp3	here the answer was not so plain and the curate had to think at least he said at length you could confess the wrong and ask forgiveness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3661.mp3	again the curate took time to reply i am endeavouring to answer your questions as well as i can he said but it is hard to deal with generalities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3662.mp3	you see how useless for that very reason my answers have as yet been still i have something more to say and hesitate only because it may imply more confidence than i dare profess and of all things i dread untruth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3663.mp3	for surely there cannot be any other kind of god than the father of jesus christ
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3664.mp3	therefore surely the first step for anyone who has committed such a crime must be to humble himself before god confess the sin and ask forgiveness and cleansing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3665.mp3	and the creature he has made and if god heard the man's prayer and forgave him then the man would certainly know it in his heart and be consoled perhaps by the gift of humility
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3666.mp3	then you think confession to god is all that is required if there be no one else wronged to whom confession can be made if the case were mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3667.mp3	and sometimes i much fear that in taking holy orders i have grievously sinned i should then do just as i have done with regard to that cry to the living power which i think originated me to set the matter right for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3668.mp3	then to forgive and console me alas alas that he will not hear of he would rather be punished than consoled i fear for his brain but indeed that might be well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3669.mp3	she had gone much farther than she had intended but the more doubtful help became the more she was driven by the agony of a perishing hope to search the heart of wingfold again the curate pondered are you sure he said at length
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3670.mp3	that the person of whom you speak is not neglecting something he ought to do something he knows perhaps he had come back to the same with which he started through her veil he saw her turn deadly white
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3671.mp3	ever since leopold said the word jury a ghastly fear had haunted helen she pressed her hand on her heart and made no answer i speak from experience the curate went on from what else could i speak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3672.mp3	i know that so long as we hang back from doing what conscience urges there is no peace for us i will not say our prayers are not heard for mister polwarth has taught me that the most precious answer prayer can have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3673.mp3	lies in the growing strength of the impulse towards the dreaded duty and in the ever sharper stings of the conscience i think i asked already whether there were no relatives to whom reparation could be made yes yes gasped helen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3674.mp3	and i told you reparation was impossible her voice had sunk almost to a groan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3675.mp3	why if you will believe me they were the sons of that very phrixus who in his childhood had been carried to colchis on the back of the golden fleeced ram since that time phrixus had married the king's daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3676.mp3	and had spent their play days in the outskirts of the grove in the center of which the golden fleece was hanging upon a tree they were now on their way to greece in hopes of getting back a kingdom that had been wrongfully taken from their father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3677.mp3	when the princes understood whither the argonauts were going they offered to turn back and guide them to colchis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3678.mp3	every person who might venture within his reach there are other difficulties in the way continued the young princes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3679.mp3	i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible you have grown up from infancy in the fear of this monster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3680.mp3	at all events turn back who may i will never see greece again unless i carry with me the golden fleece we will none of us turn back cried his nine and forty brave comrades
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3681.mp3	much good may it do him and orpheus whose custom it was to set everything to music began to harp and sing most gloriously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3682.mp3	and nothing so truly honorable as to be eaten up at one mouthful in case of the worst after this being now under the guidance of the two princes who were well acquainted with the way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3683.mp3	heard of their arrival he instantly summoned jason to court
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3684.mp3	who dethroned his father you are welcome brave jason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3685.mp3	pray are you on a pleasure voyage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3686.mp3	or what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court great sir replied jason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3687.mp3	for chiron had taught him how to behave with propriety whether to kings or beggars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3688.mp3	provided i bring him the golden fleece this as your majesty is aware is now hanging on a tree here at colchis and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away in spite of himself the king's face twisted itself into an angry frown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3689.mp3	for above all things else in the world he prized the golden fleece and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3690.mp3	had come to colchis with the sole purpose of taking away his chief treasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3691.mp3	what are the conditions which you must fulfill before getting possession of the golden fleece i have heard rejoined the youth that a dragon lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs and that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3692.mp3	true said the king with a smile that did not look particularly good natured very true young man but there are other things as hard or perhaps a little harder to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon for example
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3693.mp3	which vulcan the wonderful blacksmith made for me there is a furnace in each of their stomachs and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths and nostrils that nobody has hitherto gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small black cinder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3694.mp3	i must encounter the peril answered jason composedly since it stands in the way of my purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3695.mp3	from which cadmus raised a crop of armed men they are an unruly set of reprobates those sons of the dragon's teeth and unless you treat them suitably they will fall upon you sword in hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3696.mp3	and the four footed pedant his schoolmaster into the bargain why what a foolhardy self conceited coxcomb he is we'll see what my fire breathing bulls will do for him well prince jason he continued aloud and as complaisantly as he could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3697.mp3	make yourself comfortable for to day and to morrow morning since you insist upon it you shall try your skill at the plow while the king talked with jason a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne she fixed her eyes earnestly upon the youthful stranger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3698.mp3	this young woman followed him out of the room i am the king's daughter she said to him and my name is medea i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of if you will trust to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3699.mp3	i can instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls and sow the dragon's teeth and get the golden fleece indeed beautiful princess answered jason if you will do me this service i promise to be grateful to you my whole life long gazing at medea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3700.mp3	he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery so that while looking into them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3701.mp3	yet can never be certain whether you see into the farthest depths or whether there be not something else hidden at the bottom if jason had been capable of fearing anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3702.mp3	for beautiful as she now looked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3703.mp3	princess he exclaimed you seem indeed very wise and very powerful but how can you help me to do the things of which you speak are you an enchantress yes prince jason answered medea with a smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3704.mp3	it is well for you that i am favorably inclined for otherwise you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon i should not so much care for the dragon replied jason if i only knew how to manage the brazen footed and fiery lunged bulls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3705.mp3	which will prevent you from being burned up and cure you if you chance to be a little scorched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3706.mp3	which it contained and where to meet her at midnight only be brave added she and before daybreak the brazen bulls shall be tamed the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him he then rejoined his comrades and told them what had passed between the princess and himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3707.mp3	and warned them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their help at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the king's palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3708.mp3	just as they had been pulled out of the monster's jaws by cadmus long ago medea then led jason down the palace steps and through the silent streets of the city and into the royal pasture ground where the two brazen footed bulls were kept it was a starry night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3709.mp3	with a bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3710.mp3	in that farthest corner of the field it will be excellent sport i assure you when they catch a glimpse of your figure my father and all his court delight in nothing so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them in order to come at the golden fleece
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3711.mp3	it makes a holiday in colchis whenever such a thing happens for my part i enjoy it immensely you cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling of an eye their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black cinder are you sure beautiful medea asked jason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3712.mp3	the instant he made a step farther
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3713.mp3	these you will understand were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as they lay chewing their cuds at the first two or three steps which jason made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3714.mp3	the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp and were lifting up their hot noses to snuff the air he went a little farther
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3715.mp3	one other stride did bold jason make and suddenly as a streak of lightning on came these fiery animals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3716.mp3	as has always been the fashion with angry bulls their breath scorched the herbage before them so intensely hot it was indeed that it caught a dry tree under which jason was now standing and set it all in a light blaze but as for jason himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3717.mp3	greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a cinder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3718.mp3	just as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air he caught one of them by the horn and the other by his screwed up tail and held them in a gripe like that of an iron vice one with his right hand the other with his left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3719.mp3	to be sure but the secret of the matter was that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures and that jason had broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling them and ever since that time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3720.mp3	when danger assails them to do what they call taking the bull by the horns and to gripe him by the tail is pretty much the same thing that is to throw aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3721.mp3	it was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to the plow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3722.mp3	who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed to the plow at any rate our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking up the greensward and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky the plowed field lay before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3723.mp3	a large tract of black earth ready to be sown with the dragon's teeth so jason scattered them broadcast and harrowed them into the soil with a brush harrow and took his stand on the edge of the field anxious to see what would happen next
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3724.mp3	must we wait long for harvest time he inquired of medea who was now standing by his side whether sooner or later it will be sure to come answered the princess a crop of armed men never fails to spring up when the dragon's teeth have been sown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3725.mp3	and whole months before the yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle but by and by all over the field
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3726.mp3	like sparkling drops of dew these bright objects sprouted higher and proved to be the steel heads of spears then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets beneath which as they grew farther out of the soil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3727.mp3	tore themselves up by the roots wherever a dragon's tooth had fallen there stood a man armed for battle they made a clangor with their swords against their shields and eyed one another fiercely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3728.mp3	full of rage and stormy passions and ready to take the life of every human brother in recompense of the boon of their own existence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3729.mp3	and how it would have rejoiced any great captain who was bent on conquering the world like alexander or napoleon to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as jason did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3730.mp3	clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over with the red hot thirst for battle then they began to shout show us the enemy lead us to the charge death or victory come on brave comrades conquer or die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3731.mp3	and a hundred other outcries such as men always bellow forth on a battle field and which these dragon people seemed to have at their tongues ends at last the front rank caught sight of jason who beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3732.mp3	had thought it best to draw his sword in a moment all the sons of the dragon's teeth appeared to take jason for an enemy and crying with one voice guard the golden fleece they ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded spears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3733.mp3	the armed men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes when he let fly the stone and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3734.mp3	and instead of running any farther towards jason they began to fight among themselves the confusion spread through the host
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3735.mp3	hewing and stabbing at one another lopping off arms heads and legs and doing such memorable deeds that jason was filled with immense admiration although at the same time he could not help laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3736.mp3	for an offense which he himself had committed in an incredibly short space of time almost as short indeed as it had taken them to grow up all but one of the heroes of the dragon's teeth were stretched lifeless on the field
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3737.mp3	the last survivor the bravest and strongest of the whole had just force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head and give a shout of exultation crying victory victory immortal fame
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3738.mp3	when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his slain brethren and there was the end of the army that had sprouted from the dragon's teeth that fierce and feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3739.mp3	let them sleep in the bed of honor said the princess medea with a sly smile at jason the world will always have simpletons enough just like them fighting and dying for they know not what and fancying that posterity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3740.mp3	will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets could you help smiling prince jason to see the self conceit of that last fellow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3741.mp3	you will think differently in the morning said medea true the golden fleece may not be so valuable as you have thought it but then there is nothing better in the world and one must needs have an object you know come your night's work has been well performed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3742.mp3	that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3743.mp3	entering the presence chamber he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low obeisance your eyes look heavy prince jason observed the king you appear to have spent a sleepless night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3744.mp3	and have concluded not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame my brazen lunged bulls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3745.mp3	the field has been plowed the dragon's teeth have been sown broadcast and harrowed into the soil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3746.mp3	and depart with my nine and forty comrades
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3747.mp3	and looked very angry and excessively disturbed for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece if his courage and skill should enable him to do so but since the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of the brazen bulls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3748.mp3	and the dragon's teeth the king feared that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon and therefore though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful he was resolved and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3749.mp3	not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece you never would have succeeded in this business young man said he if my undutiful daughter medea had not helped you with her enchantments had you acted fairly you would have been at this instant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3750.mp3	to speak my mind plainly you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks jason left the king's presence in great sorrow and anger he could think of nothing better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3751.mp3	march at once to the grove of mars slay the dragon take possession of the golden fleece get on board the argo and spread all sail for iolchos the success of this scheme depended it is true on the doubtful point
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3752.mp3	at so many mouthfuls by the dragon but as jason was hastening down the palace steps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3753.mp3	and although she had done him so much service only the night before he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset these enchantresses you must know are never to be depended upon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3754.mp3	will he give you the golden fleece without any further risk or trouble on the contrary answered jason he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragon's teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3755.mp3	and he forbids me to make any more attempts and positively refuses to give up the golden fleece whether i slay the dragon or no yes jason said the princess and i can tell you more unless you set sail from colchis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3756.mp3	stealing through the streets of colchis on their way to the sacred grove
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3757.mp3	lowing nodding their heads and thrusting forth their snouts which as other cattle do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3758.mp3	their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed and with their fierceness the two furnaces in their stomachs had likewise been extinguished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3759.mp3	than ever before indeed it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor animals that whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass the fire out of their nostrils had shriveled it up before they could manage to crop it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3760.mp3	how they contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine but now instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapor they breathed the very sweetest of cow breath after kindly patting the bulls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3761.mp3	jason followed medea's guidance into the grove of mars where the great oak trees that had been growing for centuries threw so thick a shade that the moonbeams struggled vainly to find their way through it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3762.mp3	medea squeezed jason's hand look yonder she whispered do you see it gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a radiance not like the moonbeams but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3763.mp3	what is it asked jason have you come so far to seek it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3764.mp3	when it glitters before your eyes it is the golden fleece jason went onward a few steps farther and then stopped to gaze o how beautiful it looked shining with a marvelous light of its own that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3765.mp3	prize which so many heroes had longed to behold but had perished in the quest of it either by the perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of the brazen lunged bulls how gloriously it shines cried jason in a rapture it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3766.mp3	the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of jason's memory soon however something came to pass that reminded him what perils were still to be encountered an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3767.mp3	for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung and seizing the poor antelope swallowed him with one snap of his jaws after this feat the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within reach
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3768.mp3	on which he felt inclined to finish his meal in various directions he kept poking his ugly snout among the trees stretching out his neck a terrible long way now here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3769.mp3	upon my word as the head came waving and undulating through the air and reaching almost within arm's length of prince jason it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3770.mp3	the gape of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the king's palace well jason whispered medea for she was ill natured as all enchantresses are and wanted to make the bold youth tremble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3771.mp3	what do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden fleece jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward stay foolish youth said medea grasping his arm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3772.mp3	far more effectually than your sword the dragon had probably heard the voices for swift as lightning his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again darting full forty feet at a stretch as it approached
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3773.mp3	medea tossed the contents of the gold box right down the monster's wide open throat immediately with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggle flinging his tail up to the tip top of the tallest tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3774.mp3	and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down again the dragon fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless it is only a sleeping potion said the enchantress to prince jason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3775.mp3	so i did not wish to kill him outright quick snatch the prize and let us begone you have won the golden fleece jason caught the fleece from the tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3776.mp3	with her peacock beside her she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste disappeared among the duskiness of the trees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3777.mp3	who were disporting themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible but lynceus with his sharp eyes had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden fleece
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3778.mp3	although several stone walls a hill and the black shadows of the grove of mars intervened between by his advice the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3779.mp3	held perpendicularly ready to let fall into the water as jason drew near he heard the talking image calling to him with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave sweet voice make haste prince jason for your life make haste
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3780.mp3	it's late alexey alexandrovitch she said when she had gone through the doorway anna it's necessary for me to have a talk with you with me she said wonderingly she came out from behind the door of the dressing room and looked at him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3781.mp3	why what is it what about she asked sitting down well let's talk if it's so necessary but it would be better to get to sleep anna said what came to her lips and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3782.mp3	how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3783.mp3	that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3784.mp3	she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3785.mp3	that she did not care to say a word about herself meant a great deal he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were closed against him more than that he saw from her tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3786.mp3	that she was not even perturbed at that but as it were said straight out to him yes it's shut up and so it must be and will be in future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have returning home and finding his own house locked up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3787.mp3	but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexey alexandrovitch i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3788.mp3	your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis attracted attention he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3789.mp3	i wasn't dull does that offend you alexey alexandrovitch shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3790.mp3	anna is this you said alexey alexandrovitch quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his fingers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3791.mp3	what do you want of me alexey alexandrovitch paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3792.mp3	he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3793.mp3	and i beg you to listen to it i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be influenced by it but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i observed it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3794.mp3	but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired i positively don't understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he doesn't care she thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3795.mp3	but other people noticed it and that's what upsets him you're not well alexey alexandrovitch she added and she got up and would have gone towards the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her his face was ugly and forbidding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3796.mp3	as anna had never seen him she stopped and bending her head back and on one side began with her rapid hand taking out her hairpins well i'm listening to what's to come she said calmly and ironically and indeed i listen with interest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3797.mp3	began alexey alexandrovitch ferreting in one's soul one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3798.mp3	to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3799.mp3	i don't understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins anna for god's sake don't speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3800.mp3	but believe me what i say i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the word love threw her into revolt again she thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3801.mp3	love can he love if he hadn't heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he doesn't even know what love is alexey alexandrovitch really i don't understand she said define what it is you find
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3802.mp3	that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3803.mp3	in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3804.mp3	when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3805.mp3	but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and had forgotten about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3806.mp3	she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexey alexandrovitch seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3807.mp3	with a new tranquil rhythm it's late it's late she whispered with a smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3808.mp3	right off i observed a cluster of mountains about two thousand feet high whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted after our position fix i reentered the lounge and when our bearings were reported on the chart i saw that we were off the island of ceylon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3809.mp3	that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula i went looking in the library for a book about this island one of the most fertile in the world sure enough i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singhalese
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3810.mp3	reentering the lounge i first noted the bearings of ceylon on which antiquity lavished so many different names
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3811.mp3	its length is two hundred seventy five miles its maximum width one hundred fifty miles its circumference nine hundred miles its surface area twenty four thousand four hundred forty eight square miles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3812.mp3	in other words a little smaller than that of ireland just then captain nemo and his chief officer appeared the captain glanced at the chart then turning to me the island of ceylon he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3813.mp3	is famous for its pearl fisheries would you be interested professor aronnax
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3814.mp3	certainly captain fine it's easily done only when we see the fisheries we'll see no fishermen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3815.mp3	and we'll arrive there late tonight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3816.mp3	who went out immediately soon the nautilus reentered its liquid element and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet with the chart under my eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3817.mp3	i found it by the ninth parallel off the northwestern shores of ceylon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3818.mp3	to reach it we had to go all the way up ceylon's west coast professor captain nemo then told me there are pearl fisheries in the bay of bengal the seas of the east indies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3819.mp3	the seas of china and japan plus those seas south of the united states the gulf of panama and the gulf of california but it's off ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards no doubt we'll be arriving a little early
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3820.mp3	only during the month of march and for thirty days some three hundred boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea each boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen the latter divide into two groups
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3821.mp3	dive in rotation and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat you mean i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3822.mp3	that such primitive methods are still all that they use all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3823.mp3	although these fisheries belong to the most industrialized people in the world the english
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3824.mp3	yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman service in such work yes since those poor fishermen can't stay long underwater on his voyage to ceylon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3825.mp3	the englishman percival made much of a kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface but i find that hard to believe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3826.mp3	i know that some divers can last up to fifty seven seconds and highly skillful ones to eighty seven but such men are rare
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3827.mp3	i believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3828.mp3	their vision weakens ulcers break out on their eyes sores form on their bodies and some are even stricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor yes i said it's a sad occupation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3829.mp3	and one that exists only to gratify the whims of fashion but tell me captain how many oysters can a boat fish up in a workday
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3830.mp3	it's even said that in eighteen fourteen when the english government went fishing on its own behalf its divers worked just twenty days and brought up seventy six million oysters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3831.mp3	the fishermen are well paid aren't they hardly professor in panama they make just one dollar per week in most places they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl and they bring up so many that have none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3832.mp3	only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich that's atrocious on that note professor captain nemo told me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3833.mp3	and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early well we can watch him at work that suits me captain by the way professor aronnax you aren't afraid of sharks are you sharks i exclaimed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3834.mp3	this struck me as a pretty needless question to say the least well captain nemo went on i admit captain i'm not yet on very familiar terms with that genus of fish we're used to them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3835.mp3	the rest of us captain nemo answered and in time you will be too anyhow we'll be armed and on our way we might hunt a man eater or two it's a fascinating sport so professor i'll see you tomorrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3836.mp3	bright and early this said in a carefree tone captain nemo left the lounge if you're invited to hunt bears in the swiss mountains you might say oh good i get to go bear hunting tomorrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3837.mp3	if you're invited to hunt lions on the atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of india you might say ha now's my chance to hunt lions and tigers but if you're invited to hunt sharks in their native element
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3838.mp3	you might want to think it over before accepting as for me i passed a hand over my brow where beads of cold sweat were busy forming let's think this over i said to myself and let's take our time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3839.mp3	hunting otters in underwater forests as we did in the forests of crespo island is an acceptable activity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3840.mp3	that's another story i know that in certain countries particularly the andaman islands negroes don't hesitate to attack sharks dagger in one hand and noose in the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3841.mp3	but i also know that many who face those fearsome animals don't come back alive besides i'm not a negro and even if i were a negro in this instance i don't think a little hesitation on my part would be out of place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3842.mp3	and there i was fantasizing about sharks envisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half i could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3843.mp3	and how i resented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his deplorable invitation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3844.mp3	thank heavens i said to myself conseil will never want to come along and that'll be my excuse for not going with the captain as for ned land i admit i felt less confident of his wisdom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3845.mp3	danger however great held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature i went back to reading sirr's book but i leafed through it mechanically between the lines i kept seeing fearsome wide open jaws
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3846.mp3	just then conseil and the canadian entered with a calm even gleeful air little did they know what was waiting for them ye gods sir ned land told me your captain nemo the devil take him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3847.mp3	has just made us a very pleasant proposition oh i said you know about with all due respect to master conseil replied the nautilus's commander has invited us together with master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3848.mp3	for a visit tomorrow to ceylon's magnificent pearl fisheries he did so in the most cordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman he didn't tell you anything else nothing sir the canadian replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3849.mp3	he said you'd already discussed this little stroll indeed i said but didn't he give you any details on not a one mister naturalist you will be going with us right me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3850.mp3	why yes certainly of course i can see that you like the idea mister land yes it will be a really unusual experience and possibly dangerous i added in an insinuating tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3851.mp3	dangerous ned land replied a simple trip to an oysterbank assuredly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3852.mp3	for my part i stared at them with anxious eyes as if they were already missing a limb or two should i alert them yes surely but i hardly knew how to go about it would master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3853.mp3	conseil said to me give us some background on pearl fishing on the fishing itself i asked or on the occupational hazards that on the fishing the canadian replied before we tackle the terrain it helps to be familiar with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3854.mp3	all right sit down my friends
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3855.mp3	ned and conseil took seats on a couch and right off the canadian said to me sir just what is a pearl exactly my gallant ned i replied for poets a pearl is a tear from the sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3856.mp3	for orientals it's a drop of solidified dew for the ladies it's a jewel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3857.mp3	necks and ears that's oblong in shape glassy in luster and formed from mother of pearl for chemists it's a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with a little gelatin protein
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3858.mp3	and finally for naturalists it's a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces mother of pearl in certain bivalves branch mollusca conseil said class
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3859.mp3	acephala order testacea correct my scholarly conseil now then those testacea capable of producing pearls include rainbow abalone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3860.mp3	turbo snails giant clams and saltwater scallops briefly all those that secrete mother of pearl in other words that blue azure violet or white substance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3861.mp3	lining the insides of their valves are mussels included too the canadian asked yes the mussels of certain streams in scotland wales ireland saxony bohemia and france
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3862.mp3	good the canadian replied from now on we'll pay closer attention to em but i went on for secreting pearls the ideal mollusk is the pearl oyster meleagrina margaritifera
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3863.mp3	that valuable shellfish pearls result simply from mother of pearl solidifying into a globular shape either they stick to the oyster's shell or they become embedded in the creature's folds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3864.mp3	on the valves a pearl sticks fast on the flesh it lies loose but its nucleus is always some small hard object say a sterile egg or a grain of sand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3865.mp3	around which the mother of pearl is deposited in thin concentric layers over several years in succession can one find several pearls in the same oyster conseil asked yes my boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3866.mp3	they even mention one oyster about which i remain dubious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3867.mp3	ned land yelped did i say sharks i exclaimed hastily i meant one hundred fifty pearls sharks wouldn't make sense indeed conseil said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3868.mp3	but will master now tell us how one goes about extracting these pearls one proceeds in several ways and often when pearls stick to the valves fishermen even pull them loose with pliers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3869.mp3	thus they die in the open air and by the end of ten days they've rotted sufficiently next they're immersed in huge tanks of salt water then they're opened up and washed at this point the sorters begin their twofold task
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3870.mp3	first they remove the layers of mother of pearl which are known in the industry by the names legitimate silver bastard white or bastard black
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3871.mp3	then they remove the oyster's meaty tissue boil it and finally strain it in order to extract even the smallest pearls do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size conseil asked not only on their size i replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3872.mp3	but also according to their shape their water in other words their color and their orient in other words that dappled shimmering glow that makes them so delightful to the eye the finest pearls are called virgin pearls or paragons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3873.mp3	they form in isolation within the mollusk's tissue they're white often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency and usually spherical or pear shaped the spherical ones are made into bracelets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3874.mp3	the pear shaped ones into earrings and since they're the most valuable they're priced individually the other pearls that stick to the oyster's shell are more erratically shaped and are priced by weight finally classed in the lowest order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3875.mp3	the smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls they're priced by the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church vestments but it must be a long hard job sorting out these pearls by size
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3876.mp3	the canadian said no my friend that task is performed with eleven strainers or sieves that are pierced with different numbers of holes those pearls staying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3877.mp3	those not slipping through the sieves pierced with one hundred to eight hundred holes are in the second order finally those pearls for which one uses strainers pierced with nine hundred to one thousand holes make up the seed pearls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3878.mp3	how ingenious conseil said to reduce dividing and classifying pearls to a mechanical operation and could master tell us the profits brought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters according to sirr's book i replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3879.mp3	these ceylon fisheries are farmed annually for a total profit of three million man eaters francs conseil rebuked yes francs three million francs i went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3880.mp3	but i don't think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did similarly the central american fisheries
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3881.mp3	but now they bring in only two thirds of that amount all in all it's estimated that nine million francs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl harvesting industry but conseil asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3882.mp3	haven't certain famous pearls been quoted at extremely high prices yes my boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3883.mp3	i've even heard stories the canadian said about some lady in ancient times who drank pearls in vinegar cleopatra conseil shot back it must have tasted pretty bad ned land added abominable ned my friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3884.mp3	conseil replied but when a little glass of vinegar is worth one million five hundred thousand francs its taste is a small price to pay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3885.mp3	ned land married to cleopatra conseil exclaimed but i was all set to tie the knot conseil the canadian replied in all seriousness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3886.mp3	i even bought a pearl necklace for my fiancee kate tender but she married somebody else instead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3887.mp3	but you can absolutely trust me on this professor its pearls were so big
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3888.mp3	my gallant ned i replied laughing those were artificial pearls ordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with essence of orient wow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3889.mp3	that essence of orient must sell for quite a large sum as little as zero it comes from the scales of a european carp it's nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is preserved in ammonia it's worthless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3890.mp3	maybe that's why kate tender married somebody else replied mister land philosophically but i said getting back to pearls of great value i don't think any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by captain nemo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3891.mp3	this one conseil said pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass case exactly and i'm certainly not far off when i estimate its value at two million uh francs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3892.mp3	conseil said quickly yes i said two million francs and no doubt all it cost our captain was the effort to pick it up ha ned land exclaimed during our stroll tomorrow who says we won't run into one just like it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3893.mp3	conseil put in and why not what good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the nautilus here no ned land said but elsewhere oh elsewhere conseil put in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3894.mp3	shaking his head in fact i said mister land is right and if we ever brought back to europe or america a pearl worth millions it would make the story of our adventures more authentic and much more rewarding that's how i see it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3895.mp3	the canadian said but said conseil who perpetually returned to the didactic side of things is this pearl fishing ever dangerous no i replied quickly especially if one takes certain precautions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3896.mp3	what risks would you run in a job like that ned land said swallowing a few gulps of salt water whatever you say ned then trying to imitate captain nemo's carefree tone i asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3897.mp3	by the way gallant ned are you afraid of sharks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3898.mp3	the canadian replied i'm a professional harpooner it's my job to make a mockery of them it isn't an issue i said of fishing for them with a swivel hook hoisting them onto the deck of a ship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3899.mp3	opening the belly ripping out the heart and tossing it into the sea so it's an issue of yes precisely in the water in the water ye gods just give me a good harpoon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3900.mp3	you see sir these sharks are badly designed they have to roll their bellies over to snap you up and in the meantime ned land had a way of pronouncing the word snap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3901.mp3	well how about you conseil what are your feelings about these man eaters me conseil said i'm afraid i must be frank with master good for you i thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3902.mp3	they were habitually indifferent to self exaltation and allowed themselves to be thrust into this or that unfitting role professing that the queen's government and the good of the country were their only considerations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3903.mp3	because it was felt on all sides that sir orlando could not join the new composite party without high place and the same grace was shown in regard to lord drummond who remained at the colonies keeping the office to which he had been lately transferred under mister daubeny
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3904.mp3	for legal offices have a signification differing much from that which attaches itself to places simply political a lord chancellor becomes a peer and on going out of office enjoys a large pension when the woolsack has been reached there comes an end of doubt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3905.mp3	and a beginning of ease sir gregory was not a young man and this was a terrible blow but he bore it manfully saying not a word when the duke spoke to him but he became convinced from that moment that no more inefficient lawyer ever sat upon the english bench
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3906.mp3	or a more presumptuous politician in the british parliament than lord ramsden the real struggle however lay in the appropriate distribution of the rattlers and the robys the fitzgibbons and the macphersons among the subordinate offices of state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3907.mp3	mister macpherson and mister roby with a host of others who had belonged to mister daubeny were prepared as they declared from the first to lend their assistance to the duke they had consulted mister daubeny on the subject and mister daubeny told them that their duty lay in that direction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3908.mp3	at the first blush of the matter the arrangement took the form of a gracious tender from themselves to a statesman called upon to act in very difficult circumstances and they were thanked accordingly by the duke with something of real cordial gratitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3909.mp3	he was astounded not so much by the pretensions as by the unblushing assertion of these pretensions in reference to places which he had been innocent enough to think were always bestowed at any rate without direct application he had measured himself rightly when he told the older duke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3910.mp3	in one of those anxious conversations which had been held before the attempt was made that long as he had been in office himself he did not know what was the way of bestowing office two gentlemen have been here this morning he said one day to the duke of saint bungay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3911.mp3	one on the heels of the other each assuring me not only that the whole stability of the enterprise depends on my giving a certain office to him but actually telling me to my face that i had promised it to him the old statesman laughed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3912.mp3	to be told within the same half hour by two men that i had made promises to each of them inconsistent with each other who were the two men mister rattler and mister roby i am assured that they are inseparable since the work was begun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3913.mp3	they always had a leaning to each other and now i hear they pass their time between the steps of the carlton and reform clubs but what am i to do one must be patronage secretary no doubt they're both good men in their way you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3914.mp3	but why do they come to me with their mouths open like dogs craving a bone it used not to be so of course men were always anxious for office as they are now well yes we've heard of that before to day i think
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3915.mp3	but i don't think any man ever ventured to ask mister mildmay time had done much for him in consolidating his authority and perhaps the present world is less reticent in its eagerness than it was in his younger days i doubt however
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3916.mp3	whether it is more dishonest and whether struggles were not made quite as disgraceful to the strugglers as anything that is done now you can't alter the men and you must use them the younger duke sat down and sighed over the degenerate patriotism of the age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3917.mp3	but at last even the rattlers and robys were fixed if not satisfied and a complete list of the ministry appeared in all the newspapers though the thing had been long a doing still it had come suddenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3918.mp3	so that at the first proposition to form a coalition ministry the newspapers had hardly known whether to assist or to oppose the scheme there was no doubt in the minds of all these editors and contributors the teaching of a tradition that coalitions of this kind have been generally feeble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3919.mp3	sometimes disastrous and on occasions even disgraceful when a man perhaps through a long political life has bound himself to a certain code of opinions how can he change that code at a moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3920.mp3	and when at the same moment together with the change he secures power patronage and pay how shall the public voice absolve him but then again men who have by the work of their lives grown into a certain position in the country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3921.mp3	and have unconsciously but not therefore less actually made themselves indispensable either to this side in politics or to that cannot free themselves altogether from the responsibility of managing them when a period comes such as that now reached
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3922.mp3	this also the newspapers perceived and having since the commencement of the session been very loud in exposing the disgraceful collapse of government affairs could hardly refuse their support to any attempt at a feasible arrangement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3923.mp3	when it was first known that the duke of omnium had consented to make the attempt they had both on one side and the other been loud in his praise going so far as to say that he was the only man in england who could do the work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3924.mp3	but when the newspapers told him that he was the only man for the occasion how could he be justified in crediting himself in preference to them the work in parliament began under the new auspices with great tranquillity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3925.mp3	and further education questions all men knew who knew anything but for the moment for the month even perhaps for the session there was to be peace with full latitude for the performance of routine duties there was so to say no opposition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3926.mp3	and at first it seemed that one special bench in the house of commons would remain unoccupied but after a day or two on one of which mister daubeny had been seen sitting just below the gangway that gentleman returned to the place usually held by the prime minister's rival
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3927.mp3	saying with a smile that it might be for the convenience of the house that the seat should be utilised mister gresham at this time had with declared purpose asked and obtained the speaker's leave of absence and was abroad who should lead the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3928.mp3	that had been a great question caused by the fact that the prime minister was in the house of lords and what office should the leader hold mister monk had consented to take the exchequer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3929.mp3	was at last assigned to sir orlando drought it will never do said mister rattler to mister roby i don't mean to say anything against drought who has always been a very useful man to your party but he lacks something of the position
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3930.mp3	the fact is said roby that we've trusted to two men so long that we don't know how to suppose any one else big enough to fill their places monk wouldn't have done the house doesn't care about monk i always thought it should be wilson
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3931.mp3	and so i told the duke he had an idea that it should be one of your men i think he's right there said roby there ought to be something like a fair division individuals might be content but the party would be dissatisfied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3932.mp3	for myself i'd have sooner stayed out as an independent member but daubeny said that he thought i was bound to make myself useful i told the duke from the beginning said rattler that i didn't think that i could be of any service to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3933.mp3	of course i would support him but i had been too thoroughly a party man for a new movement of this kind but he said just the same that he considered i was bound to join him i asked gresham and when gresham said so too of course i had no help for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3934.mp3	a meaning to a man's words exactly opposite to that which another tone would convey or if he does lie in doing so he does not know that he lies mister rattler had gone back to his old office at the treasury
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3935.mp3	and mister roby had been forced to content himself with the secretaryship at the admiralty but as the old duke had said they were close friends and prepared to fight together any battle which might keep them in their present position
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3936.mp3	many of the cares of office the prime minister did succeed in shuffling off altogether on to the shoulders of his elder friend he would not concern himself with the appointment of ladies about whom he said he knew nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3937.mp3	and as to whose fitness and claims he professed himself to be as ignorant as the office messenger the offers were of course made in the usual form as though coming direct from the queen through the prime minister but the selections were in truth effected by the old duke in council with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3938.mp3	an illustrious personage the matter affected our duke only in so far that he could not get out of his mind that strange application from his own wife that she should have even dreamed of it he would say to himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3939.mp3	the desire for ploughing had come upon the duchess but the duke could not understand it he perceived however in spite of the multiplicity of his official work that his refusal sat heavily on his wife's breast and that though she spoke no further word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3940.mp3	she brooded over her injury and his heart was sad within him when he thought that he had vexed her loving her as he did with all his heart but with a heart that was never demonstrative when she was unhappy he was miserable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3941.mp3	though he would hardly know the cause of his misery her ridicule and raillery he could bear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3942.mp3	or her sullenness if ever she were sullen upset him altogether he was in truth so soft of heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3943.mp3	he had expressly asked her for her sympathy in the business he had on hand thereby going much beyond his usual coldness of manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3944.mp3	had promised that she would slave for him if slavery were necessary then she had made her request had been refused and was now moody the duchess of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3945.mp3	is to be mistress of the robes he said to her one day he had gone to her up to her own room before he dressed for dinner having devoted much more time than as prime minister he ought to have done to a resolution that he would make things straight with her and to the best way of doing it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3946.mp3	so i am told she ought to know her way about the place as i remember she was at the same work when i was a girl of eleven that's not so very long ago cora silverbridge is older now than i was then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3947.mp3	and i think that makes it a very long time ago lord silverbridge was the duke's eldest son but what does it matter if she began her career in the time of george the fourth what is it to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3948.mp3	it's a pity she should not remember hers in the way she dresses said the duchess this was marvellous to him that his wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3949.mp3	that it won't come within the compass of my office to effect or even to propose any radical change in her grace's apparel but don't you think that you and i can afford to ignore all that i can certainly she may be an antiquated eve for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3950.mp3	i hope cora you are not still disappointed because i did not agree with you when you spoke about the place for yourself not because you did not agree with me but because you did not think me fit to be trusted with any judgment of my own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3951.mp3	and free from bonds by which they are cramped and confined of course such a turn of character is subject to certain dangers of its own there is no doubt about the dangers the chances are that when i see her grace i shall tell her what i think about her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3952.mp3	you will i am sure say nothing unkind to a lady who is supposed to be in the place she now fills by my authority but do not let us quarrel about an old woman i won't quarrel with you even about a young one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3953.mp3	you do not know how constantly i carry you about with me you carry a very unnecessary burden then she said but he could tell at once from the altered tone of her voice and from the light of her eye as he glanced into her face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3954.mp3	that her anger about the robes was appeased i have done as you asked about a friend of yours he said this occurred just before the final and perfected list of the new men had appeared in all the newspapers what friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3955.mp3	mister finn is to go to ireland go to ireland how do you mean it is looked upon as being very great promotion indeed i am told that he is considered to be the luckiest man in all the scramble you don't mean as chief secretary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3956.mp3	yes i do he certainly couldn't go as lord lieutenant but they said that barrington erle was going to ireland well yes i don't know that you'd be interested by all the ins and outs of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3957.mp3	the one man in parliament modest enough not to consider himself to be fit for any place that can be offered to him poor barrington he does not like the idea of crossing the channel so often i quite sympathise with him and so phineas is to be secretary for ireland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3958.mp3	not in the cabinet no not in the cabinet it is not by any means usual that he should be that is promotion and i am glad poor phineas i hope they won't murder him or anything of that kind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3959.mp3	they do murder people you know sometimes he's an irishman himself that's just the reason why they should he must put up with that of course i wonder whether she'll like going they'll be able to spend money which they always like
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3960.mp3	over there he comes backwards and forwards every week doesn't he not quite that i believe i shall miss her if she has to stay away long i know you don't like her i do like her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3961.mp3	she has always behaved well both to me and to my uncle she was an angel to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3962.mp3	this she said with a smile as though not meaning it altogether but yet half meaning it i have asked him to undertake the office said the duke solemnly because i am told that he is fit for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3963.mp3	but i did have some pleasure in proposing it to him because i thought that it would please you it does please me and i won't be cross any more and the duchess of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3964.mp3	but she is in truth the only woman in london to whom i can say what i think and it is a comfort you know to have some one in this way the domestic peace of the prime minister was readjusted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3965.mp3	and that sympathy and co operation for which he had first asked was accorded to him it may be a question whether on the whole the duchess did not work harder than he did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3966.mp3	in regard to magnificence and hospitality she said nothing of any extraordinary expenditure of money but she set herself to work after her own fashion making to him suggestions as to dinners and evening receptions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3967.mp3	to which he objected only on the score of time you must eat your dinner somewhere she said and you need only come in just before we sit down and go into your own room if you please without coming upstairs at all i can at any rate do that part of it for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3968.mp3	neither at dinner on that evening at manchester square nor after dinner as long as missus roby remained in the house was a word said about lopez by mister wharton he remained longer than usual with his bottle of port wine in the dining room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3969.mp3	but as soon as missus roby was gone and missus roby went home round the corner somewhat earlier than usual then mister wharton woke up instantly and made inquiry of his daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3970.mp3	there had however been a few words spoken on the subject between missus roby and her niece which had served to prepare emily for what was coming lopez has been to your father

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3972.mp3	no doubt your papa will have it out with you just now so you had better make up your mind what you will say to him if you really like the man i don't see why you shouldn't say so and stick to it he has made a regular offer and girls in these days are not expected to be their father's slaves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3973.mp3	missus roby was pleased with little intrigues was addicted to the amusement of fostering love affairs was fond of being thought to be useful in such matters and was not averse to having presents given to her she had married a vulgar man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3974.mp3	and though she had not become like the man she had become vulgar she was not an eligible companion for mister wharton's daughter a matter as to which the father had not given himself proper opportunities of learning the facts an aunt in his close neighbourhood was so great a comfort to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3975.mp3	so ready and so natural an assistance to him in his difficulties but emily wharton was not in the least like her aunt nor had missus wharton been at all like missus roby no doubt the contact was dangerous

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3978.mp3	which strangers did not find on her face but as we do not light up our houses with our brightest lamps for all comers so neither did she emit from her eyes their brightest sparks till special occasion for such shining had arisen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3979.mp3	to those who were allowed to love her no woman was more lovable there was innate in her an appreciation of her own position as a woman and with it a principle of self denial as a human being which it was beyond the power of any missus roby to destroy

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3983.mp3	and mister wharton had felt himself bound to abstain from allusion to such matters from an assured feeling that he could not in that direction plant an enduring objection in this way lopez had carried his point with mister wharton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3984.mp3	and this he had done without ever having asked for her love and he had even taken the trouble to allure dick and had listened to and had talked whole pages out of bell's life on his own behalf it must be acknowledged
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/3985.mp3	that he did love the girl as well perhaps as he was capable of loving any one but he had found out many particulars as to mister wharton's money before he had allowed himself to love her as soon as missus roby had gathered up her knitting

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4016.mp3	would not one say he was speaking of a religious community in truth my dear captain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4017.mp3	and by and by by and by we will see ah sire it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4018.mp3	the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4019.mp3	la vieuville said he take my place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4020.mp3	ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of justice before everything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4021.mp3	yes sire as they always do and how did the thing happen let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord in the most simple and natural manner possible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4022.mp3	and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4023.mp3	had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning the party was to take place at saint germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4024.mp3	who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah you incline me to think so said the king there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves i do not accuse them sire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4025.mp3	but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4026.mp3	then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty cannot be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4027.mp3	are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal yes treville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4028.mp3	but i will not swear to it sire you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4029.mp3	you are right treville but they were not alone your musketeers they had a youth with them yes sire and one wounded man so that three of the king's musketeers one of whom was wounded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4030.mp3	and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal's guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4031.mp3	one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself d'artagnan sire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4032.mp3	he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well tell me how treville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4033.mp3	placing his hand upon his hip sire resumed treville as i told you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4034.mp3	he was dressed as a citizen the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see treville interrupted the king it was they who attacked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4035.mp3	that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4036.mp3	brave young man murmured the king well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4037.mp3	he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4038.mp3	it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom well sire for once he found his master i will see this young man treville i will see him and if anything can be done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4039.mp3	it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand treville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel it is a brawl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4040.mp3	that is true said the king but never mind treville come still by the back staircase treville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4041.mp3	he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4042.mp3	but d'artagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4043.mp3	d'artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4044.mp3	and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine o'clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve the two musketeers were already there and were playing together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4045.mp3	although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4046.mp3	and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4047.mp3	passed so close to d'artagnan's face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4048.mp3	his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4049.mp3	declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4050.mp3	look at me as long as you like my little gentleman i have said what i have said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4051.mp3	you're in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing what is your name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4052.mp3	lest it be observed that we go out together you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way that's true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4053.mp3	that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4054.mp3	which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4055.mp3	never mind be content i will do my best on guard but said he whom d'artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4056.mp3	bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4057.mp3	he hoped to intimidate but d'artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4058.mp3	and as d'artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d'artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4059.mp3	in whose service he had a relative
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4060.mp3	and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d'artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4061.mp3	and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4062.mp3	at these cries all who were in the hotel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4063.mp3	to his eminence thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king's musketeers in these quarrels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4064.mp3	to the rescue musketeers to the rescue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4065.mp3	who hastened to the succor of their comrades the melee became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4066.mp3	the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4067.mp3	excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hotel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4068.mp3	domestics in daring to make a sortie upon the king's musketeers the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o'clock struck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4069.mp3	they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too strong they soon tired of the sport besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4070.mp3	who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4071.mp3	and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4072.mp3	and the two will pass off together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4073.mp3	directed his course toward the louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of saint germain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4074.mp3	required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4075.mp3	the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner and the king has seen the cardinal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4076.mp3	gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4077.mp3	everyone to return home and wait for news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4078.mp3	with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal's guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king's musketeers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4079.mp3	whose relative as we already know bernajoux was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4080.mp3	but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hotel they had endeavored to burn now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4081.mp3	he repaired therefore immediately to his hotel and caused himself to be announced the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem both were men of courage and honor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4082.mp3	we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4083.mp3	and all the fault is with your musketeers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4084.mp3	not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4085.mp3	in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4086.mp3	of which the doctor says bad things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4087.mp3	perfectly does he talk with difficulty but he can speak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4088.mp3	let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4089.mp3	then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4090.mp3	placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4091.mp3	returned to his hotel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4092.mp3	that his eminence's guardsmen had received
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4093.mp3	not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4094.mp3	his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4095.mp3	he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4096.mp3	whom he had sent home two hours before from the hotel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him the reader may ask
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4097.mp3	when he was left stiff as a rush in london in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses has anyone brought a letter for me asked d'artagnan eagerly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4098.mp3	but one has come of itself what do you mean blockhead i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4099.mp3	i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom and where is that letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4100.mp3	it is not natural for letters to enter people's houses in this manner if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but no all was hermetically sealed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4101.mp3	there is certainly some magic underneath meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4102.mp3	there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you be this evening about ten o'clock at saint cloud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4103.mp3	while reading this letter d'artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4104.mp3	his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4105.mp3	did i not guess truly is it not some bad affair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4106.mp3	exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut up houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4107.mp3	my dear planchet i am the happiest of men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4108.mp3	which the liberality of d'artagnan had not entirely effaced left alone d'artagnan read and reread his billet then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4109.mp3	at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4110.mp3	i am going out for all day perhaps you are therefore your own master till seven o'clock in the evening but at seven o'clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4111.mp3	we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways you will take your musketoon and your pistols
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4112.mp3	ah like the charming journey the other day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4113.mp3	i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4114.mp3	well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4115.mp3	perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said d'artagnan and nodding to planchet he went out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4116.mp3	d'artagnan's intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4117.mp3	besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at saint cloud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4118.mp3	the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4119.mp3	whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal's executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4120.mp3	d'artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4121.mp3	in a tine of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4122.mp3	brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4123.mp3	far from here oh lord no about forty leagues only
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4124.mp3	where my friends still remain and you have returned have you not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4125.mp3	as i see there is no concealing anything from you yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4126.mp3	and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4127.mp3	so trifling indeed that d'artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man ah may you be a true prophet said d'artagnan laughing no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4128.mp3	is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked d'artagnan do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4129.mp3	particularly in the night what the deuce can you expect i am no swordsman well don't be alarmed if i return at one two or three o'clock in the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4130.mp3	that d'artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4131.mp3	which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little this evening you said well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4132.mp3	this evening will come thank god and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4133.mp3	so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend amuse yourself well replied bonacieux
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4134.mp3	he certainly would not have remarked it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4135.mp3	his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative he found treville in a joyful mood he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4136.mp3	he had retired at one o'clock under the pretense of being indisposed as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six o'clock in the morning now said treville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4137.mp3	now let us talk about yourself my young friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4138.mp3	the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied d'artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4256.mp3	and emptied the cartridge box or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut they did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade which was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him on one body that of a corporal he found a powder flask

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4266.mp3	jikininki once when muso kokushi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4267.mp3	for a long time he wandered about helplessly and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night when he perceived on the top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun one of those little hermitages called
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4268.mp3	which are built for solitary priests it seemed to be in ruinous condition but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest from whom he begged the favor of a night's lodging
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4269.mp3	this the old man harshly refused but he directed muso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining where lodging and food could be obtained muso found his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4270.mp3	but a little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man carrying a lighted lantern entered the room respectfully saluted him and said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4271.mp3	the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4272.mp3	strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has thus been left so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us we can find you good lodging in the other village
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4273.mp3	but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death when i came for though i was a little tired i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest had you told me i could have performed the service before your departure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4274.mp3	as it is i shall perform the service after you have gone away and i shall stay by the body until morning i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4275.mp3	then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the adjoining room having been told of the priest's kind promises came to thank him after which the master of the house said now reverend sir much as we regret to leave you alone we must bid you farewell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4276.mp3	by the rule of our village none of us can stay here after midnight we beg kind sir that you will take every care of your honorable body while we are unable to attend upon you and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4277.mp3	all then left the house except the priest who went to the room where the dead body was lying the usual offerings had been set before the corpse and a small buddhist lamp tomyo was burning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4278.mp3	the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies after which he entered into meditation so meditating he remained through several silent hours and there was no sound in the deserted village
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4279.mp3	but when the hush of the night was at its deepest there noiselessly entered a shape vague and vast and in the same moment muso found himself without power to move or speak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4280.mp3	he saw that shape lift the corpse as with hands devour it more quickly than a cat devours a rat beginning at the head and eating everything the hair and the bones and even the shroud and the monstrous thing having thus consumed the body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4281.mp3	turned to the offerings and ate them also then it went away as mysteriously as it had come when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling all in turn saluted him and when they had entered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4282.mp3	and looked about the room no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings but the master of the house said to muso reverent sir you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4283.mp3	all of us were anxious about you but now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible but the law of our village as i told you last evening obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4284.mp3	and to leave the corpse alone whenever this law has been broken heretofore some great misfortune has followed whenever it is obeyed we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence perhaps you have seen the cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4285.mp3	then muso told of the dim and awful shape that had entered the death chamber to devour the body and the offerings no person seemed to be surprised by his narration and the master of the house observed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4286.mp3	what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time muso then inquired does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead what priest the young man asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4287.mp3	the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village answered muso i called at his anjitsu on the hill yonder he refused me lodging but told me the way here the listeners looked at each other as in astonishment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4288.mp3	and after a moment of silence the master of the house said reverend sir there is no priest and there is no anjitsu on the hill for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood muso said nothing more on the subject
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4289.mp3	for it was evident that his kind hosts supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin but after having bidden them farewell and obtained all necessary information as to his road he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4290.mp3	and this time its aged occupant invited him to enter when he had done so the hermit humbly bowed down before him exclaiming ah i am ashamed i am very much ashamed i am exceedingly ashamed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4291.mp3	you need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter said muso you directed me to the village yonder where i was very kindly treated and i thank you for that favor i can give no man shelter the recluse made answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4292.mp3	so in that time the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here sometimes from great distances in order that i might repeat over them the holy service but i repeated the service and performed the rites only as a matter of business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4293.mp3	i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain and because of this selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of a jikininki
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4294.mp3	since then i have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district every one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night now reverend sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4295.mp3	help me by your prayers i entreat you so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4296.mp3	even to day in the courts of certain japanese temples you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose the largest collection of this kind that i ever saw was in the court of a temple of the jodo sect at hakata in kyushu
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4297.mp3	who presented her mirror to the temple to be used for bell metal but afterwards she much regretted her mirror she remembered things that her mother had told her about it and she remembered that it had belonged not only to her mother but to her mother's mother and grandmother and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4298.mp3	but she had not the money necessary whenever she went to the temple she saw her mirror lying in the court yard behind a railing among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together she knew it by the sho chiku bai in relief on the back of it those three fortunate emblems of pine bamboo and plumflower
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4299.mp3	which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror she longed for some chance to steal the mirror and hide it that she might thereafter treasure it always but the chance did not come and she became very unhappy felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4300.mp3	a saying mystically expressed by the chinese character for soul upon the backs of many bronze mirrors and she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined but she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4301.mp3	evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving she had not presented her offering with all her heart and therefore her selfish soul remaining attached to the mirror kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4302.mp3	of course everybody heard of the matter and everybody soon knew whose mirror it was that would not melt and because of this public exposure of her secret fault the poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry and as she could not bear the shame she drowned herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4303.mp3	after having written a farewell letter containing these words when i am dead it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell but to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it great wealth will be given by the ghost of me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4304.mp3	but the bell proved to be a good bell and it bravely withstood their assaults nevertheless the people were not easily discouraged day after day at all hours they continued to ring the bell furiously caring nothing whatever for the protests of the priests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4305.mp3	so the ringing became an affliction and the priests could not endure it and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp the swamp was deep and swallowed it up and that was the end of the bell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4306.mp3	or bell of mugen now there are queer old japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation implied though not described by the verb
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4307.mp3	the word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any english word for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4308.mp3	to compare to liken but the esoteric meaning is to substitute in imagination one object or action for another so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4309.mp3	for example you cannot afford to build a buddhist temple but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the buddha with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one the merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal or almost equal to the merit of erecting a temple
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4310.mp3	you cannot read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy one volumes of the buddhist texts but you can make a revolving library containing them turn round by pushing it like a windlass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4311.mp3	so much will perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of nazoraeru the magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples but for present purposes the following will serve if you should make a little man of straw
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4312.mp3	for the same reason that sister helen made a little man of wax and nail it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4313.mp3	that would illustrate one signification of nazoraeru or let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night and carried away your valuables if you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden and then promptly burn a very large moxa on each of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4314.mp3	the soles of the feet of the robber will become inflamed and will allow him no rest until he returns of his own accord to put himself at your mercy that is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term nazoraeru
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4315.mp3	after the bell had been rolled into the swamp there was of course no more chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4316.mp3	but persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and break objects imaginatively substituted for the bell thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble one of these persons was a woman called umegae
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4317.mp3	while the pair were traveling together kajiwara one day found himself in great straits for want of money and umegae remembering the tradition of the bell of mugen took a basin of bronze and mentally representing it to be the bell beat upon it until she broke it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4318.mp3	crying out at the same time for three hundred pieces of gold a guest of the inn where the pair were stopping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4319.mp3	afterwards a song was made about umegae's basin of bronze and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this day umegae no chozubachi tataite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4320.mp3	if by striking upon the wash basin of umegae i could make honorable money come to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4321.mp3	became great and many people followed the example of umegae thereby hoping to emulate her luck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4322.mp3	as it deserves to be answered take therefore this jar so saying she put the jar into his hands and disappeared into his house the happy man rushed to tell his wife the good news he set down in front of her the covered jar which was heavy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4323.mp3	and they opened it together and they found that it was filled up to the very brim with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4324.mp3	all the capacities of a daring and skillful soldier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4325.mp3	but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone and as his heart remained true to his former lord he preferred to give up the world so he cut off his hair and became a traveling priest taking the buddhist name of kwairyo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4326.mp3	as in other years he had laughed at peril so now also he scorned danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4327.mp3	so he resigned himself to pass the night under the stars and having found a suitable grassy spot by the roadside he lay down there and prepared to sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4328.mp3	he had always welcomed discomfort and even a bare rock was for him a good bed when nothing better could be found and the root of a pine tree an excellent pillow his body was iron and he never troubled himself about dews or rain or frost or snow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4329.mp3	scarcely had he lain down when a man came along the road carrying an axe and a great bundle of chopped wood this woodcutter halted on seeing kwairyo lying down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4330.mp3	and after a moment of silent observation said to him in a tone of great surprise what kind of a man can you be good sir that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this there are haunters about here many of them are you not afraid of hairy things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4331.mp3	my friend cheerfully answered kwairyo i am only a wandering priest a cloud and water guest as folks call it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4332.mp3	as for lonesome places i like them they are suitable for meditation i am accustomed to sleeping in the open air and i have learned never to be anxious about my life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4333.mp3	to lie down here this place has a bad name a very bad name but as the proverb has it kunshi ayayuki ni chikayorazu the superior man does not needlessly expose himself to peril
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4334.mp3	and i must assure you sir that it is very dangerous to sleep here therefore although my house is only a wretched thatched hut let me beg of you to come home with me at once in the way of food i have nothing to offer you but there is a roof at least and you can sleep under it without risk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4335.mp3	accepted this modest offer the woodcutter guided him along a narrow path leading up from the main road through mountain forest it was a rough and dangerous path sometimes skirting precipices sometimes offering nothing but a network of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4336.mp3	slippery roots for the foot to rest upon sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock but at last kwairyo found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill with a full moon shining overhead and he saw before him a small thatched cottage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4337.mp3	and they must have been taught by some one well acquainted with the rules of propriety then turning to his host the aruji or house master as the others called him kwairyo said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4338.mp3	from the kindness of your speech and from the very polite welcome given me by your household i imagine that you have not always been a woodcutter perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classes smiling the woodcutter answered sir you are not mistaken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4339.mp3	though now living as you find me i was once a person of some distinction my story is the story of a ruined life ruined by my own fault i used to be in the service of a daimyo and my rank in that service was not inconsiderable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4340.mp3	but i loved women and wine too well and under the influence of passion i acted wickedly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4341.mp3	retribution followed me and i long remained a fugitive in the land now i often pray that i may be able to make some atonement for the evil which i did and to reestablish the ancestral home but i fear that i shall never find any way of so doing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4342.mp3	kwairyo was pleased by this announcement of good resolve and he said to the aruji my friend i have had occasion to observe that man prone to folly in their youth may in after years become very earnest in right living
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4343.mp3	in the holy sutras it is written that those strongest in wrong doing can become by power of good resolve the strongest in right doing i do not doubt that you have a good heart and i hope that better fortune will come to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4344.mp3	to night i shall recite the sutras for your sake and pray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past errors with these assurances kwairyo bade the aruji good night and his host showed him to a very small side room where a bed had been made ready
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4345.mp3	then all went to sleep except the priest who began to read the sutras by the light of a paper lantern until a late hour he continued to read and pray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4346.mp3	the night was beautiful there was no cloud in the sky there was no wind and the strong moonlight threw down sharp black shadows of foliage and glittered on the dews of the garden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4347.mp3	and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night kwairyo felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4348.mp3	very gently he pushed apart the sliding screens that separated his room from the main apartment and he saw by the light of the lantern five recumbent bodies without heads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4349.mp3	for one instant he stood bewildered imagining a crime but in another moment he perceived that there was no blood and that the headless necks did not look as if they had been cut then he thought to himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4350.mp3	and remove the body to another place the head will never be able to join itself again to the neck and the book further says that when the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved it will strike itself upon the floor three times bounding like a ball and will pant as in great fear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4351.mp3	and presently die now if these be rokuro kubi they mean me no good so i shall be justified in following the instructions of the book he seized the body of the aruji by the feet pulled it to the window and pushed it out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4352.mp3	gently unbarring the door he made his way to the garden and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it he heard voices talking in the grove and he went in the direction of the voices stealing from shadow to shadow until he reached a good hiding place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4353.mp3	then from behind a trunk he caught sight of the heads all five of them flitting about and chatting as they flitted they were eating worms and insects which they found on the ground or among the trees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4354.mp3	presently the head of the aruji stopped eating and said ah that traveling priest who came to night how fat all his body is when we shall have eaten him our bellies will be well filled i was foolish to talk to him as i did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4355.mp3	to go near him while he is reciting would be difficult and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying but as it is now nearly morning perhaps he has gone to sleep some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4356.mp3	another head the head of a young woman immediately rose up and flitted to the house lightly as a bat after a few minutes it came back and cried out huskily in a tone of great alarm that traveling priest is not in the house he is gone but that is not the worst of the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4357.mp3	he has taken the body of our aruji and i do not know where he has put it at this announcement the head of the aruji distinctly visible in the moonlight assumed a frightful aspect its eyes opened monstrously its hair stood up bristling and its teeth gnashed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4358.mp3	since my body has been moved to rejoin it is not possible then i must die and all through the work of that priest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4359.mp3	and there he is behind that tree hiding behind that tree see him the fat coward in the same moment the head of the aruji followed by the other four heads sprang at kwairyo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4360.mp3	but the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree and with that tree he struck the heads as they came knocking them from him with tremendous blows four of them fled away but the head of the aruji though battered again and again desperately continued to bound at the priest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4361.mp3	and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe kwairyo however as quickly gripped the head by its topknot and repeatedly struck it it did not release its hold but it uttered a long moan and thereafter ceased to struggle it was dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4362.mp3	but its teeth still held the sleeve and for all his great strength kwairyo could not force open the jaws with the head still hanging to his sleeve he went back to the house and there caught sight of the other four rokuro kubi squatting together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4363.mp3	with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies but when they perceived him at the back door all screamed the priest the priest and fled through the other doorway out into the woods eastward the sky was brightening day was about to dawn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4364.mp3	and kwairyo knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness he looked at the head clinging to his sleeve its face all fouled with blood and foam and clay and he laughed aloud as he thought to himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4365.mp3	after which he gathered together his few belongings and leisurely descended the mountain to continue his journey right on he journeyed until he came to suwa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4366.mp3	seized the priest and took him to jail for they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who in the moment of being killed had caught the murderer's sleeve in his teeth as the kwairyo he only smiled and said nothing when they questioned him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4367.mp3	so after having passed a night in prison he was brought before the magistrates of the district then he was ordered to explain how he a priest had been found with the head of a man fastened to his sleeve and why he had dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4368.mp3	kwairyo laughed long and loudly at these questions and then he said sirs i did not fasten the head to my sleeve it fastened itself there much against my will and i have not committed any crime for this is not the head of a man it is the head of a goblin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4369.mp3	but the magistrates did not laugh they judged him to be a hardened criminal and his story an insult to their intelligence therefore without further questioning they decided to order his immediate execution all of them except one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4370.mp3	a very old man this aged officer had made no remark during the trial but after having heard the opinion of his colleagues he rose up and said let us first examine the head carefully for this i think has not yet been done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4371.mp3	the old man turned it round and round carefully examined it and discovered on the nape of its neck several strange red characters he called the attention of his colleagues to these and also bade them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4372.mp3	on the contrary the line of leverance was smooth as the line at which a falling leaf detaches itself from the stem then said the elder i am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth this is the head of a rokuro kubi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4373.mp3	there are the characters you can see for yourselves that they have not been painted moreover it is well known that such goblins have been dwelling in the mountains of the province of kai from very ancient time but you sir he exclaimed turning to kwairyo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4374.mp3	perhaps you once belonged to the samurai class
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4375.mp3	before becoming a priest i long followed the profession of arms and in those days i never feared man or devil my name then was isogai heidazaemon taketsura of kyushu there may be some among you who remember it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4376.mp3	at the mention of that name a murmur of admiration filled the court room for there were many present who remembered it and kwairyo immediately found himself among friends instead of judges friends anxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4377.mp3	when kwairyo left suwa he was as happy as any priest is permitted to be in this transitory world as for the head he took it with him jocosely insisting that he intended it for a miyage and now it only remains to tell what became of the head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4378.mp3	a day or two after leaving suwa kwairyo met with a robber who stopped him in a lonesome place and bade him strip kwairyo at once removed his koromo and offered it to the robber who then first perceived what was hanging to the sleeve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4379.mp3	though brave the highwayman was startled he dropped the garment and sprang back then he cried out you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4380.mp3	kwairyo answered i shall let you have the head and the robe if you insist but i must tell you that this is not the head of a man it is a goblin's head so if you buy it and have any trouble in consequence please to remember that you were not deceived by me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4381.mp3	what a nice priest you are exclaimed the robber you kill men and jest about it but i am really in earnest here is my robe and here is the money and let me have the head what is the use of joking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4382.mp3	take the thing said kwairyo i was not joking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4383.mp3	and he then became afraid that the spirit of the rokuro kubi might give him trouble so he made up his mind to take back the head to the place from which it had come and to bury it with its body he found his way to the lonely cottage in the mountains of kai but nobody was there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4384.mp3	and he could not discover the body therefore he buried the head by itself in the grove behind the cottage and he had a tombstone set up over the grave and he caused a segaki service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of the rokuro kubi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4385.mp3	woman's vanity often outruns her natural diffidence and the consciousness of her great beauty stifles the conscience of modesty visitors to the academy know the picture circe seated

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4387.mp3	while upon the tesselated pavement before the dais purple grapes and yellow roses have been strewn the black hair of the daughter of perseis falls in profusion about her bare shoulders and strays over her breast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4388.mp3	but her features are hidden by a half mask of black silk the lips with their arc de cupidon are slightly parted disclosing an even row of pearly teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4389.mp3	of the thousands who have gazed upon it in admiration none knows the somewhat remarkable story connected with it as i have been closely associated with it from the day it was outlined in charcoal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4390.mp3	until the evening it was packed in a crate and sent for the inspection of the hanging committee it is perhaps apropos that i should relate the narrative the studio of my old friend dick carruthers the man who painted it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4391.mp3	is on campden hill kensington within a few hundred yards of where i reside and in the centre of an aesthetic artistic colony we have been chums for years for on many occasions he has displayed his talent as a black and white artist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4392.mp3	in illustrating my articles and stories in various magazines he is a popular painter and as handsome a man as ever had a picture on the line three years ago when the prologue of this secret drama was enacted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4393.mp3	he was in the habit of coming over when the light had faded to smoke a cigarette and discuss art and literature with me i was glad of a chat after a hard day's work at my writing table but his companionship had one drawback
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4394.mp3	he drivelled over a girl he loved and was forever suggesting that i might take her as a character and drag her into the novel upon which i was engaged one day he drew a cabinet photograph carefully from his pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4395.mp3	and placed it upon the blotting pad before me the girl he loved bah i knew her though i did not tell him so she was a dark haired pink and white beauty that flitted through artistic bohemia like a butterfly in a hothouse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4396.mp3	the sight of the pictured face brought back to me the memory of days long past of a closed chapter in my life's history i remembered the first time i saw ethel broughton fully five years before she wore a soiled pink wrapper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4397.mp3	her satin slippers were trodden down at heel and she had a bottle of champagne at her elbow at that time her lover grandiloquent and impecunious mister harry oranmore a bad but handsome actor had been untrue to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4398.mp3	and she a third rate actress who had an ingenue part at a strand theatre
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4399.mp3	but she scarcely heeded me probably she was thinking of oranmore for she clasped her slim fingers round her suffering throat and offered up an occasional sob following it with a silent but protracted draught from her glass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4400.mp3	the result of this interview was but natural dazzled by her beauty i sympathised with her endeavoured to cheer her and concluded by falling violently in love with her at that time i was writing numbers of dramatic criticisms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4401.mp3	and i confess i used what weight my opinions possessed for the purpose of her advancement it is needless to refer to the smooth and uninterrupted course of our love suffice it to say that we were both bohemians
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4402.mp3	and that within a year i had the satisfaction of sitting before the footlights watching her make her debut as leading lady at a west end theatre and a few days later of observing her photograph exhibited in shop windows among those of other stage beauties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4403.mp3	but alas those halcyon days were all too brief suddenly the scales fell from my eyes a scene occurred between us and we parted to think that sin should lie for years in the blood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4404.mp3	just as arsenic does in a corpse when i discovered that dick carruthers was wasting the very honest and ardent emotions of his heart at this feverish fairy's shrine i resolved to take him aside and without admitting that i knew her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4405.mp3	give him a verbal drubbing i did so but he bit his moustache fiercely and turned upon me she is charming he said and i love her ah i know the type
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4406.mp3	you know nothing old fellow he exclaimed flushing angrily but he shrugged his shoulders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4407.mp3	you shall see her before long his gaze grew bright soft and vague as one who catches glimpses of the floating garments of supernatural mysteries ah she is lovely only an artist can appreciate her beauty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4408.mp3	heedless of everything under the spell she had cast about him one night not long after i had expressed my sentiments to him regarding his infatuation i entered his studio and found his goddess seated by the fire with her shapely feet upon the fender
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4409.mp3	and holding a lighted cigarette between her dainty fingers dick flung down his palette and came forward to introduce me her dark eyes met mine and we tacitly agreed not to recognise each other therefore we bowed as perfect strangers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4410.mp3	i caught her glancing furtively at me under her long lashes she had grown even handsomer than when last i had seen her and was the picture of the romantic bohemienne her dress was of black gauze through which the milky whiteness of her figure seemed to shine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4411.mp3	yet as she turned her beautiful face towards me i was struck by the complete effect of physical and moral frailty that she presented she expressed pleasure at meeting me remarking that she had read my last novel and had been keenly interested in it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4412.mp3	when i had briefly acknowledged the compliment she paid me she said one thing always strikes me in reading your stories your women are inevitably false and fickle perhaps however you write from personal experience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4413.mp3	of the failings of my sex she laughed glancing sharply at her i saw that her eyes did not waver it is true i once knew a woman who proved false and infamous i replied with some emphasis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4414.mp3	and you avenge yourself by reviling all of us it is really too bad she said pouting like a spoiled child by jove old fellow dick chimed in do tell us about your romance it would be interesting to know the reason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4415.mp3	you set your face against all the fair ones but i succeeded in turning the conversation into another channel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4416.mp3	so making an excuse i bade them au revoir and returned to my own book lined den unlocking a drawer in my writing table i took out a packet of letters that still emitted a stale odour of violets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4417.mp3	then i lit my pipe and one by one read them through pausing and pondering over the declarations of passionate love they contained far into the night i sat reviewing the romance of bygone days until i came to the last letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4418.mp3	it was a cold formal note merely a few lines of hurried scrawl and read you are right i have been false to you think no more of me by the time you receive this i shall be on my way to new york
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4419.mp3	nevertheless you will be always remembered by yours unworthily ethel bitter memories of the past overwhelmed me but at last growing impatient and tossing the letters back into the drawer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4420.mp3	i strove to forget the clock had struck two and my reading lamp was burning low and sputtering when i rose to retire for the night i confess that my frame of mind surprised me inasmuch as i actually found myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4421.mp3	still loving her good afternoon i hope i don't disturb you looking up from my work i saw ethel not at all pray sit down i said coldly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4422.mp3	motioning her to an armchair to what do i owe the honour of this visit she pulled off her long gloves and let her sealskin cape fall at her feet while i put down my pen and rising stood with my back to the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4423.mp3	with her she had brought the odour of violets the same that i remembered years ago the same perfume that always stirred sad memories within me you don't welcome me very warmly she said in a disappointed tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4424.mp3	as she grasped my hand and looked steadily into my eyes no i said sternly last night i told you that a woman had embittered my life the woman i referred to was yourself ah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4425.mp3	she said striving to suppress a sob forgive me i i was mad then i loved you but i did not apprehend the consequence love what nonsense to speak of it when through your baseness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4426.mp3	i have been almost ruined think of your actions on the day before you left me how you took from that drawer a signed blank cheque with which you drew six hundred pounds nearly all the money i possessed and then fled with your lover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4427.mp3	is that the way a woman shows her affection her head was bowed in humiliation forgive me harold she said with intense earnestness i admit that i wronged you cruelly that i discarded the honest love you gave me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4428.mp3	but you you do not know how weak we women are when temptation is in our path cannot i now make amends i shook my head sadly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4429.mp3	she implored tearfully at least i am honest my object in coming this afternoon was to repay the money i i borrowed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4430.mp3	i asked hesitating to receive it i have earned it honestly every penny she replied since we parted i have become popular in america and played lead in nearly all the great cities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4431.mp3	during the years that have gone i have many many times wondered what had become of you for in your writings i read plainly how soured and embittered you had become and where is oranmore dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4432.mp3	he contracted typhoid while we were playing in san francisco and it terminated fatally ethel i said gravely taking her hand in mine you have fascinated dick carruthers my friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4433.mp3	and you will treat him as you treated me no no i love him she said in a fierce half whisper adding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4434.mp3	i will be true to him if he marries me he shall never have cause for regret never suppose i told him what would he think of you you will not she cried clinging to me you are too honourable for that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4435.mp3	promise to keep my secret for the present i will preserve silence i answered my heart softening towards her but i cannot promise that i will never tell him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4436.mp3	what character do you think would best suit me well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4437.mp3	the woman who broke men's hearts i replied mischievously excellent i shall be able to assume that character well she said with a grim smile i will tell him spring came and went
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4438.mp3	but i saw very little of dick he had received a commission from one of the illustrated papers to make a series of sketches of scenery in scotland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4439.mp3	whenever he paid flying visits to london however he always looked me up but strangely enough never mentioned ethel nevertheless i ascertained that they frequently met
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4440.mp3	at the close of a blue summer's day when the dreamy golden haze wrapped the city in a mystic charm i called at the studio having heard that he had returned and was settling down to work when i entered dick was standing before his easel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4441.mp3	pipe in mouth and crayon in hand busily sketching while on the raised throne before him sat ethel radiant and beautiful a tender smile played about her lips it seemed as though a happiness full complete
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4442.mp3	perfectly satisfying had taken possession of her and lifted her out of herself out of the world even welcome old fellow dick cried
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4443.mp3	ethel will not sit for any other subject it hardly does her justice does it it is a strange fancy of mine she explained when i had greeted her i'm sure the dress is very becoming isn't it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4444.mp3	and she waved the goblet she was holding above her head your pose is perfect dear please don't alter it urged the artist who advancing to his easel again continued the free rapid outline
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4445.mp3	presently she reappeared and we went to dine together at a restaurant in piccadilly afterwards visiting a theatre and spending a very pleasant evening poor dick i was sorry that he was so infatuated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4446.mp3	he was such a large hearted honest fellow that i felt quite pained when i anticipated the awakening that must inevitably come sooner or later he knew absolutely nothing of her past and was quite ignorant that she had been a popular actress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4447.mp3	in the months that followed i visited the studio almost daily and watched the growth of the picture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4448.mp3	the delicate tints of the neck and arms were reproduced with a skill that betrayed the master hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4449.mp3	i returned home from a stroll across kensington gardens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4450.mp3	heard some one playing upon my piano and a sweet soprano voice singing trotere's in old madrid i recognised the clear tones as those of ethel ah harold she cried jumping up as i entered the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4451.mp3	i was amusing myself until your return i i have something to tell you well what is it i asked rather surprised cannot you guess dick has asked me to become his wife she said in a low tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4452.mp3	the thing's impossible i cried warmly i will not allow it you may be friends but he shall never marry you how cruel you are she said with a touch of sadness but after all your apprehensions are groundless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4453.mp3	i have refused refused why for reasons of my own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4454.mp3	if if he speaks to you urge him to abandon thoughts of love and regard me as a friend only you are at least sensible ethel i said it is gratifying to know that you recognise the impossibility of such an union
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4455.mp3	tears welled in her eyes she nodded but did not reply a dry grey day in march it was show sunday that institution in the art world when the painter opens his studio to his friends and the public
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4456.mp3	to show them the picture he is about to send to the academy the exhibition is in many instances but the showing beforehand of the garlands of victory in a battle which is doomed to be lost for when the opening day comes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4457.mp3	has no such ordeal to face he never reads his new romance to his friends nor do his well wishers applaud in advance reviewers have first tilt at advance copies and very properly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4458.mp3	from morn till eve on show sunday campden hill is always blocked by the carriages of the curious and studios are besieged by fashionable crowds whose chatter and laughter mingles pleasantly with the clinking of tea cups
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4459.mp3	on this occasion as on previous ones i assisted dick to receive his visitors but unfortunately ethel had been taken suddenly unwell and could not attend my anticipations proved correct
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4460.mp3	the opinions of critics who dropped in were unanimous that it was the artist's masterpiece and that the expression and general conception were marvellous a verdict endorsed by gushing society women bored club men and the inane jeunesse doree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4461.mp3	a scrap of conversation i overheard in the course of the afternoon however caused me to ponder an elderly man evidently a foreigner wearing the violet ribbon of the french academy in his buttonhole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4462.mp3	was standing with a young girl in the crowd around the easel why look papa that face the girl cried when her eyes fell upon the canvas it is her portrait surely the signore cannot know dio
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4463.mp3	exclaimed the old man evidently recognising the features the picture is indeed magnificent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4464.mp3	come away zelie let us go i heard no more for they turned and left having acted as eavesdropper i could hardly question them nevertheless i was sorely puzzled look read that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4465.mp3	in surprise i glanced up from my work of romance weaving on the following morning and saw dick pale and agitated standing at my elbow the letter he placed before me was in a woman's hand and emitted the faintest breath of violets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4466.mp3	a glance was sufficient to recognise that the sprawly writing was ethel's taking it up i eagerly read the following lines it contained dear dick i regret to tell you that circumstances preclude me from ever meeting you again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4467.mp3	i am going far away where you cannot find me it was foolish for us to have loved therefore forget me that you may meet some one far worthier than myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4468.mp3	may bring you fame and fortune is the most sincere hope of your models ethel i warned you against your infatuation old fellow i said seriously but i couldn't help it i i loved her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4469.mp3	while his face assumed a hard determined expression
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4470.mp3	and she had her foot upon my neck but it is all over he added bitterly i shall think no more of her then he wished me an abrupt farewell and left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4471.mp3	that evening i called at dick's house but was informed by his housekeeper that he had packed his bag and departed stating that he would not return for at least a month perhaps longer when i entered the studio gloomy in the twilight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4472.mp3	and that it was standing in a corner with its face to the wall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4473.mp3	and when i did so i discovered to my dismay that in his frenzy of mad despair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4474.mp3	and drawn it across the face making a great ugly disfiguring daub over the forehead and eyebrows utterly ruining the features and producing a curiously forbidding effect the colour was not dry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4475.mp3	therefore i was enabled to remove the greater portion of it with a silk handkerchief but i saw with regret that the tints of the forehead had been irretrievably ruined rendering the picture valueless the days went by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4476.mp3	the limit for sending in to the academy was approaching but dick did not write and i could only wonder vaguely where he was wandering it was a great pity i thought that such a fine work should not be exhibited
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4477.mp3	yet the wilful obliteration had utterly spoiled it while sitting in his studio musing one day it suddenly occurred to me that if the flaw upon the forehead could be hidden it might after all be sent for the inspection of the hanging committee

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4510.mp3	but old durham found out what every one learns who gets his ambitions mixed up with number two red that there's a heap of it lying around loose in the country the bears did quick work and kept the cash wheat coming in so lively that one settling day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4511.mp3	and that he had better turn his attention to the stocks of mess pork
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4512.mp3	he applied for every other position on the premises right down to office boy i told him i was sorry but i couldn't do anything for him then that we were letting men go but i'd keep him in mind and so on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4513.mp3	finally after about a month of this he wore me down so that i stopped him one day as he was passing me on the street i thought i'd find out if he really was so red hot to work as he pretended to be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4514.mp3	besides i felt that perhaps i hadn't treated the boy just right as i had delivered quite a jag of that wheat to his father myself hello jim i called do you still want that job yes sir he answered quick as lightning well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4515.mp3	i tell you how it is jim i said looking up at him he was one of those husky lazy moving six footers i don't see any chance in the office but i understand they can use another good strong man in one of the loading gangs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4516.mp3	i thought that would settle jim and let me out for it's no joke lugging beef or rolling barrels and tierces a hundred yards or so to the cars but jim came right back at me with done who'll i report to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4517.mp3	that sporty way of answering as if he was closing a bet made me surer than ever that he was not cut out for a butcher but i told him and off he started hot foot to find the foreman i sent word by another route to see that he got plenty to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4518.mp3	he got to scheming around for a way to make the work easier and he hit on an idea for a sort of overhead railroad system by which the barrels could be swung out of the storerooms and run right along into the cars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4519.mp3	it was just as i thought jim was lazy but he had put the house in the way of saving so much money that i couldn't fire him so i raised his salary and made him an assistant timekeeper and checker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4520.mp3	jim kept at this for three or four months until his feet began to hurt him i guess and then he was out of a job again it seems he had heard something of a new machine for registering the men that did away with most of the timekeepers except the fellows who watched the machines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4521.mp3	of course he claimed a raise again for effecting such a saving
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4522.mp3	i was beginning to take an interest in jim so i brought him up into the office and set him to copying circular letters we used to send out a raft of them to the trade that was just before the general adoption of typewriters when they were still in the experimental stage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4523.mp3	but jim hadn't been in the office plugging away at the letters for a month before he had the writer's cramp and began nosing around again the first thing i knew he was sicking the agents for the new typewriting machine on to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4524.mp3	and he kept them pounding away until they had made me give them a trial then it was all up with mister jim's job again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4525.mp3	jim made two trips without selling enough to keep them working overtime at the factory and then he came into my office with a long story about how we were doing it all wrong said we ought to go for the consumer by advertising
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4526.mp3	but jim just kept plugging away at me between trips until finally i took him off the road and told him to go ahead and try it in a small way jim pretty nearly scared me to death that first year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4527.mp3	at last he had got into something that he took an interest in spending money and he just fairly wallowed in it used to lay awake nights thinking up new ways of getting rid of the old man's profits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4528.mp3	i remember one picture he got out showing sixteen cows standing between something that looked like a letter press and telling how every pound or so of graham's extract contained the juice squeezed from a herd of steers if an explorer started for the north pole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4529.mp3	jim would send him a case of extract and then advertise that it was the great heat maker for cold climates and if some other fellow started across africa he sent him a case too and advertised what a bully drink it was served up with a little ice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4530.mp3	he broke out in a new place every day and every time he broke out it cost the house money finally i made up my mind to swallow the loss and mister jim was just about to lose his job sure enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4531.mp3	when the orders for extract began to look up and he got a reprieve then he began to make expenses and he got a pardon and finally a rush came that left him high and dry in a permanent place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4532.mp3	jim was all right in his way but it was a new way and i hadn't been broad gauged enough to see that it was a better way that was where i caught the connection between a college education and business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4533.mp3	i've always made it a rule to buy brains and i've learned now that the better trained they are the faster they find reasons for getting their salaries raised the fellow who hasn't had the training may be just as smart but he's apt to paw the air when he's reaching for ideas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4534.mp3	i suppose you're asking why if i'm so hot for education i'm against this post graduate course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4535.mp3	i see you've been elected president of your class i'm glad the boys aren't down on you but while the most popular man in his class isn't always a failure in business being as popular as that takes up a heap of time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4536.mp3	i noticed too when you were home easter that you were running to sporty clothes and cigarettes there's nothing criminal about either but i don't hire sporty clerks at all and the only part of the premises on which cigarette smoking is allowed is the fertilizer factory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4537.mp3	i simply mention this in passing i have every confidence in your ultimate good sense and i guess you'll see the point without my elaborating with a meat ax my reasons for thinking that you've had enough college for the present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4538.mp3	i never sell goods without knowing where i can find them when i want them and if these fellows try to put their forefeet in the trough or start any shoving and crowding they're going to find me forgetting my table manners too

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4544.mp3	i remember once i had a vacant lot out on the avenue and a lady came in to my office and in a soothing syrupy way asked if i would lend it to her as she wanted to build a creche on it i hesitated a little because i had never heard of a creche before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4545.mp3	and someways it sounded sort of foreign and frisky though the woman looked like a good safe reliable old heifer but she explained that a creche was a baby farm where old maids went to wash and feed and stick pins in other people's children while their mothers were off at work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4546.mp3	of course there was nothing in that to get our pastor or the police after me so i told her to go ahead she went off happy but about a week later she dropped in again looking sort of dissatisfied to find out if i wouldn't build the creche itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4547.mp3	it seemed like a worthy object so i sent some carpenters over to knock together a long frame pavilion she was mighty grateful you bet and i didn't see her again for a fortnight then she called by to say that so long as i was in the business and they didn't cost me anything special
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4548.mp3	would i mind giving her a few cows she had a surprised and grieved expression on her face as she talked and the way she put it made me feel that i ought to be ashamed of myself for not having thought of the live stock myself so i threw in half a dozen cows to provide the refreshments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4549.mp3	to ask why i hadn't had it painted i was too busy that morning to quarrel so i sent word that i would fix it up and when i was driving by there next day the painters were hard at work on it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4550.mp3	graham's extract it makes the weak strong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4551.mp3	went all around town saying that i had given a five hundred dollar shed to charity and painted a thousand dollar ad on it allowed i ought to send my check for that amount to the creche fund kept at it till i began to think there might be something in it after all and sent her the money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4552.mp3	then i found a fellow who wanted to build in that neighborhood sold him the lot cheap and got out of the creche industry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4553.mp3	but the only thing i've ever put into it which didn't draw dividends in fun or dollars was worry that is a branch of the trade which you want to leave to our competitors i've always found worrying a blamed sight more uncertain than horse racing it's harder to pick a winner at it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4554.mp3	you go home worrying because you're afraid that your fool new clerk forgot to lock the safe after you and during the night the lard refinery burns down you spend a year fretting because you think bill jones is going to cut you out with your best girl and then you spend ten worrying because he didn't
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4555.mp3	a busy man has no time to bother with it he can always find plenty of old women in skirts or trousers to spend their days worrying over their own troubles and to sit up nights waking his speaking of handing over your worries to others naturally calls to mind the widow williams and her son bud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4556.mp3	who was a playmate of mine when i was a boy bud was the youngest of the widow's troubles and she was a woman whose troubles seldom came singly had fourteen altogether and four pair of em were twins
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4557.mp3	and then she'd shed all worry over them for the rest of the day allowed that if they got hurt the neighbors would bring them home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4558.mp3	and someways the whole drove always showed up safe and dirty about meal time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4559.mp3	and so when bud's clothes were found at the swimming hole one day and no bud inside them she didn't take on up to the expectations of the neighbors who had brought the news and who were standing around waiting for her to go off into something special in the way of high strikes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4560.mp3	hinted that there'd be no funeral or such like expensive goings on until some one produced the deceased take her by and large she was a pretty cool calm cucumber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4561.mp3	and every one just quit work to tell each other what a noble little fellow he was and how his mother hadn't deserved to have such a bright little sunbeam in her home and to drag the river between talks but they couldn't get a rise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4562.mp3	but finally at the end of a week when they'd strained the whole river through their drags and hadn't anything to show for it but a collection of tin cans and dead catfish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4563.mp3	and went down the street to the cabin of louisiana clytemnestra an old yellow woman who would go into a trance for four bits and find a fortune for you for a dollar i reckon she'd have called herself a clairvoyant nowadays but then she was just a voodoo woman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4564.mp3	well the widow said she reckoned that boys ought to be let out as well as in for half price and so she laid down two bits allowing that she wanted a few minutes private conversation with her bud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4565.mp3	clytie said she'd do her best but that spirits were mighty snifty and high toned even when they'd only been poor white trash on earth and it might make them mad to be called away from their high jinks if they were taking a little recreation or from their high priced new york customers if they were working
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4566.mp3	but next day she came again and paid down four bits and clytie reckoned that that ought to fetch bud sure someways though she didn't have any luck and finally the widow suggested that she call up bud's father buck williams had been dead a matter of ten years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4567.mp3	and the old man responded promptly where's bud asked the widow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4568.mp3	no then he'd have to look downstairs for him clytie told the widow to call again and they'd get him sure so she came back next day and laid down a dollar that fetched old buck williams ghost on the jump you bet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4569.mp3	but they couldn't get a whisper even from bud i reckon clytie had been stringing the old lady along intending to produce bud's spook as a sort of red fire calcium light grand march of the amazons climax but she didn't get a chance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4570.mp3	for right there the old lady got up with a mighty set expression around her lips and marched out muttering that it was just as she had thought all along bud wasn't there and when the neighbors dropped in that afternoon to plan out a memorial service for her lost lamb
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4571.mp3	she chased them off the lot with a broom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4572.mp3	and that they would just stand pat now and wait for him to make the next move
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4573.mp3	but there wouldn't be till then altogether it looked as if there was a heap of trouble coming to bud if he had made any mistake and was still alive the widow found her lost lamb hiding behind a rain barrel when she opened up the house next morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4574.mp3	and there was a mighty touching and affecting scene in fact the widow must have touched him at least a hundred times and every time he was affected to tears for she was using a bed slat which is a powerfully strong moral agent for making a boy see the error of his ways
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4575.mp3	and it was a month after that before bud could go down main street without some man who had called him a noble little fellow or a bright manly little chap while he was drowned reaching out and fetching him a clip on the ear for having come back and put the laugh on him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4576.mp3	but it appeared that he left home to get a few indian scalps and that he came back for a little bacon and corn pone i simply mention the widow in passing as an example of the fact that the time to do your worrying is when a thing is all over and that the way to do it is to leave it to the neighbors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4577.mp3	i sail for home to morrow

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4583.mp3	and now said the commissioner we'll talk more freely we tell mantelish just as little as we can to tell you the truth trigger the professor is a terrible handicap on an operation like this i understand he was a great friend of your father's yes she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4584.mp3	going over for visits to mantelish's garden with my father is one of the earliest things i remember i can imagine he's a problem she shifted her gaze curiously from one to the other of the two men what are you people doing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4585.mp3	looking for gess fayle and the key unit holati tate said that's about it we're one of a few thousand federation groups assigned to the same general job each group works at its specialties and the information gets correlated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4586.mp3	in what way trigger asked well suppose that key unit is lost and stays lost suppose all the other plasmoids put together don't contain enough information to show how the old galactics produced the things and got them to operate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4587.mp3	somebody would get that worked out pretty soon wouldn't they
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4588.mp3	there seem to be too many basic factors missing it might be necessary to develop a whole new class of sciences first and that could take a few centuries well trigger admitted i could get along without the things indefinitely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4589.mp3	same here the plasmoid nabob agreed ungratefully weird beasties but let's see at present there are twelve hundred and fifty eight member worlds to the federation aren't there more or less
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4590.mp3	and the number of planetary confederacies subplanetary governments industrial financial and commercial combines assorted power groups et cetera and so on is something i'd hate to have to calculate what are you driving at she asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4591.mp3	they've all been told we're heading for a new golden age courtesy of the plasmoid science practically everybody has believed it now there's considerable doubt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4592.mp3	of course practically everybody is going to get very unhappy eh that said commissioner tate is only a little of it yes the thing isn't just lost somebody's got it very likely trigger nodded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4593.mp3	so any one of umpteen thousands of organizations in the hub might be the one that has that plasmoid now including said holati any one of the two hundred and fourteen restricted worlds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4594.mp3	their treaties of limitation wouldn't have let them get into the plasmoid pie until the others had been at it a decade or so they would have been quite eager there was a little pause then trigger said lordy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4595.mp3	the thing could even set off another string of wars that's a point the council is nervous about he said well it certainly is a mess you would have thought the federation might have had a security chief in on that first operation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4596.mp3	right there on harvest moon they did he said it was fayle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4597.mp3	holati could those things ever become as valuable as people keep saying it's all sounded a little exaggerated to me the commissioner said he'd wondered about it too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4598.mp3	i'm not enough of a biologist to make an educated guess what it seems to boil down to is that they might which would be enough to tempt a lot of people to gamble very high for a chance to get control of the plasmoid process
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4599.mp3	and we know definitely that some people are gambling for it how do you know we've been working a couple of leads here pretty short leads so far but you work with what you can get he nodded at the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4600.mp3	trigger glanced down the plasmoid lay there some inches from the side of her hand you know she said uncomfortably old repulsive moved again while we were talking towards my hand she drew the hand away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4601.mp3	i was watching it major quillan said reassuringly from the end of the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4602.mp3	mantelish brought it back to maccadon with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4603.mp3	he was curious because he couldn't even guess at what its function was it was just lying there in a cubicle so he did considerable experimenting with it while he waited for gess fayle to show up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4604.mp3	and league headquarters fidgeted around hoping to get the kind of report from mantelish and fayle that mantelish thought they'd already received they were wondering where fayle was too but they knew fayle was security so they didn't like to get too nosy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4605.mp3	trigger shook her head wonderful so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4606.mp3	mantelish began to get results with it the commissioner said one experiment was rather startling he'd been trying that electrical stimulation business nothing happened until he had finished then he touched the plasmoid and it fed the whole charge back to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4607.mp3	she laughed delightedly good for repulsive stood up for his rights eh mantelish gained some such impression anyway he became more cautious with it after that and then he learned something that should be important
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4608.mp3	he was visiting another lab where they had a couple of plasmoids which actually moved now and then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4609.mp3	the two lab plasmoids stopped moving while he was there they haven't moved since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4610.mp3	right he thought about that and then located another moving plasmoid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4611.mp3	the big one induces plasmoid activity the little one modifies it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4612.mp3	but his two lab guards and one of the raiders were killed the others got away gess fayle's defection was a certainty by then and everybody was very nervous the feds got there fast and dead brained the raider they learned just two things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4613.mp3	one he'd been mind blocked and couldn't have spilled any significant information even if they had got him alive the other item they drew from his brain was a clear impression of the target of the raid the professor's pal here uh huh trigger said lost in thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4614.mp3	she poked repulsive lightly that would be fayle and his associates then or somebody who knew about them did they want to kill it or grab it the commissioner looked at her grab it was the dead brain report why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4615.mp3	so they need it in connection with the key unit trigger asked probably that makes everything look very much better doesn't it quite a little he said the unit may not work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4616.mp3	mantelish talks of something he calls proximity influence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4617.mp3	so trigger said they might have two thirds of what everybody wants and you might have one third right here on the table how many of the later raiders did you catch all of them said the commissioner around forty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4618.mp3	we got them dead we got them alive it didn't make much difference they were hired hands very expensive hired hands but still just that most of them didn't know a thing we could use the ones that did know something were mind blocked again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4619.mp3	i thought trigger said reflectively you could un block someone like that you can sometimes if you're very good at it and if you have time enough we couldn't afford to wait a year they died before they could tell us anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4620.mp3	there was a pause then trigger asked how did you get involved in this personally more or less by accident the commissioner said it was in connection with our second lead that's me huh she said unhappily yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4621.mp3	why would anyone want to grab me i don't know anything he shook his head we haven't found out yet we're hoping we will in a very few days is that one of the things you can't tell me about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4622.mp3	i can tell you most of what i know at the moment said the commissioner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4623.mp3	in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4624.mp3	says the apostle paul i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4625.mp3	my kinsmen according to the flesh brethren my heart's desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved and such dear reader is in greater or less degree the feeling of every renewed heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4626.mp3	loving jesus it would fain have others love him too it desires the salvation of all but for that of its own dear ones it longs and labors and prays it is like jacob wrestling with the angel when he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4627.mp3	i will not let thee go except thou bless me and thus it was with elsie she knew now that her father was not a christian that he had no real love for jesus none of the true fear of god before his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4628.mp3	she saw that if he permitted her to read to him from god's word as he sometimes did it was not that he felt any pleasure in listening but only to please her she had no reason to suppose he ever prayed and though he went regularly to church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4629.mp3	it was because he considered it proper and respectable to do so and not that he cared to worship god or to learn his will this conviction which had gradually dawned upon elsie until now it amounted to certainty caused her great grief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4630.mp3	she shed many tears over it in secret and very many and very earnest were the prayers she offered up for her dear father's conversion she was sitting on his knee one evening in the drawing room while he and several other gentlemen were conversing on the subject of religion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4631.mp3	they were discussing the question whether or no a change of heart were necessary to salvation the general opinion seemed to be that it was not and elsie listened with pain while her father expressed his decided conviction that all who led an honest upright moral life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4632.mp3	and attended to the outward observances of religion were quite safe he could see no necessity for a change of heart he did not believe in the doctrine of total depravity not he no indeed he thought the world much better than many people would have us believe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4633.mp3	elsie fixed her eyes on his face with a very mournful gaze while he was speaking but he was busy with his argument and did not notice her but one of the guests was just expressing his approval of mister dinsmore's sentiments when catching sight of elsie's face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4634.mp3	he stopped remarking your little girl looks as if she had something to say on the subject what is it my dear elsie blushed hesitated and looked at her father yes speak my daughter if you have anything to say he said encouragingly elsie lifted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4635.mp3	marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again she repeated these words of inspiration with a deep earnest solemnity that seemed to impress every hearer for a moment there was a deep hush in the room then the gentleman asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4636.mp3	create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me where did you learn all this he asked looking at her with mingled surprise and admiration in the bible sir she modestly replied you seem to have read it to some purpose said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4637.mp3	and now since you consider that change so necessary can you tell me how it is to be brought about god's holy spirit alone can change a sinner's heart sir and how am i to secure his aid he asked elsie answered with a text
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4638.mp3	she replied the sweet little face all suffused with blushes and the soft downcast eyes filling with tears why do you think so he asked again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4639.mp3	i think there is a text that says you must be able always to give a reason for the hope that is in you or something to that effect is there not yes sir be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4640.mp3	with meekness and fear then raising her eyes to his face with a touching mixture of deep humility and holy boldness she continued and this sir is my answer jesus says him that cometh unto me i will in no wise cast out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4641.mp3	and i believe him i did go to him and he did not cast me out but forgave my sins and taught me to love him and desire to serve him all my life this conversation between the gentleman and the little girl had drawn the attention of all present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4642.mp3	and now missus dinsmore who had more than once shown signs of impatience said well elsie i think you have now talked quite enough for a child of your age then pulling out her watch it is high time for little folks to be in bed elsie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4643.mp3	blushing deeply would have retired immediately but her father held her fast saying as he gave his stepmother an angry glance you need not go elsie unless you choose i am quite capable of judging when it is time to send you to bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4644.mp3	whispered elsie who had a great dread of missus dinsmore's anger very well then you may do as you like he replied giving her a good night kiss and with a graceful good night to the company the little girl left the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4645.mp3	her questioner followed her with an admiring glance then turning to her father exclaimed warmly she is a remarkably intelligent child dinsmore one that any father might be proud of i was astonished at her answers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4646.mp3	yes remarked travilla a text has been running in my head ever since you commenced your conversation something about these things being hid from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes and he added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4647.mp3	and her father's voice said good morning little daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4648.mp3	she asked raising her head to give him a smile of joyful welcome i did not know you were there ah i have been watching you for several minutes he said always poring over the same book elsie do you never tire of it no indeed papa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4649.mp3	it is always new and i do love it so it is so very sweet may i read a little to you she added coaxingly yes i love to listen to anything read by my darling he said sitting down and taking her on his knee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4650.mp3	laid her head on his breast asking dear papa don't you believe the bible certainly daughter i am not an infidel he replied in a careless tone well then papa she continued half hesitatingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4651.mp3	i was much pleased with your intelligent answers to mister lee last evening elsie sighed and her eyes filled with tears it was not what she wanted what an odd child you are he said laughing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4652.mp3	she dropped her head on his breast and burst into tears and sobs why elsie my own darling what ails you he asked in great surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4653.mp3	the young party at roselands had now grown so large several additions having been made to it on monday afternoon and evening that a separate table was ordered to be spread for them in the nursery where they took their meals together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4654.mp3	missus brown the housekeeper taking the head of the table for the double purpose of keeping them in order and seeing that their wants were well supplied elsie came in to breakfast from a brisk walk with her papa looking fresh and rosy and bright as the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4655.mp3	quite different from some of the little guests who had been up far beyond their usual hours the night before and having just left their beds had come down pale and languid in looks and in some instances showing peevish and fretful tempers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4656.mp3	very trying to the patience of their attendants o elsie exclaimed carry howard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4657.mp3	we were all so sorry that you had to leave us so soon last night we had lots of fun after you left i think your papa might have let you stay up a little longer but he has promised that tonight as we are to have the christmas tree and ever so much will be going on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4658.mp3	late hours and rich food are very bad for little folks and i notice that miss elsie has grown a deal stronger and healthier looking since her papa came home he takes such good care of her indeed he does said elsie heartily thanking missus brown with one of her sweetest smiles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4659.mp3	whatever you all prefer said elsie if you like i will practice that duet with you the first hour after breakfast or do anything else you wish but the second hour i must spend with papa and after that i have nothing to do but entertain my company all day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4660.mp3	do you do lessons in holidays asked mary leslie a merry fun loving child about elsie's own age who considered lessons an intolerable bore and had some vague idea that they must have been invented for the sole purpose of tormenting children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4661.mp3	her blue eyes opened wide with astonishment when elsie quietly replied that her papa had kindly arranged to give her an hour every morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4662.mp3	than spending the whole day in play elsie did keenly enjoy that quiet hour spent in studying and reciting to her father sitting on a low stool at his feet or perhaps oftener on his knee with his arm around her waist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4663.mp3	loving also his little pupil with all a father's fond yearning affection delighted in his task when elsie left her father she found that the carringtons had just arrived
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4664.mp3	she and lucy had not seen each other since the week the latter had spent at roselands early in the summer and both felt pleased to meet missus carrington gave elsie a warm embrace remarking that she had grown and was looking extremely well better than she had ever seen her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4665.mp3	but no one was more delighted to meet elsie than herbert and she was very glad to learn that his health was gradually improving he was not however at all strong even yet and his mother thought it best for him to lie down and rest a little after his ride
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4666.mp3	a variety of story books toys and games had been provided for their amusement elsie's entrance was hailed with delight for she was a general favorite oh elsie can't you tell us what to play cried mary leslie i'm so tired
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4667.mp3	and she yawned wearily here are some dissected maps mary replied elsie opening a drawer would you not like them no indeed thank you they are too much like lessons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4668.mp3	will you play jack stones here are some smooth pebbles yes if you and carry and lucy will play with me agreed said the others let's have a game so elsie having first set the little ones to building block houses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4669.mp3	supplied harry carrington an older brother of lucy's with a book and two younger boys with dissected maps to arrange the four girls sat down in a circle on the carpet and began their game for a few moments all went on smoothly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4670.mp3	who was sobbing and wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron enna took my blocks sobbed the child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4671.mp3	you know flora is a visitor and we must be very polite to her no i won't returned enna flatly she's got enough now no i haven't i can't build a house with those flora said with another sob
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4672.mp3	elsie stood a moment looking much perplexed then with a brightening face exclaimed in her cheerful pleasant way well never mind flora dear i will get you my doll
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4673.mp3	the little weeper answered eagerly smiling through her tears elsie ran out of the room and was back again almost in a moment with the doll in her arms there dear little flora she said laying it gently on the child's lap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4674.mp3	please be careful of it for i have had it a long while and prize it very much because my guardian gave it to me when i was a very little girl and he is dead now i won't break it elsie indeed i won't replied flora confidently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4675.mp3	and elsie sat down to her game again a few moments afterward mister horace dinsmore passed through the room elsie he said as he caught sight of his little daughter go up to my dressing room there was evidently displeasure and reproof in his tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4676.mp3	mister dinsmore passed out of one door while elsie left by the other the three little girls looked inquiringly into each other's faces what is the matter what has elsie done asked carry in a whisper i don't know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4677.mp3	nothing i guess replied lucy indignantly i do believe he's just the crossest man alive when i was here last summer he was all the time scolding and punishing poor elsie for just nothing at all i think he must be very strict said carry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4678.mp3	and that was the conclusion they all came to in the meantime elsie sat down alone in her banishment and tried to think what she could have done to deserve it it was some time before she could form any idea of its cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4679.mp3	but at length it suddenly came to her recollection that once several months before this her father had found her sitting on the carpet and had bade her get up immediately and sit on a chair or stool saying never let me see you sitting on the floor elsie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4680.mp3	when there are plenty of seats at hand i consider it a very unladylike and slovenly trick she covered her face with her hands and sat thus for some moments feeling very sorry for her forgetfulness and disobedience very penitent on account of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4681.mp3	and then kneeling down she asked forgiveness of god a full hour she had been there alone and the time had seemed very long when at last the door opened and her father came in elsie rose and came forward to meet him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4682.mp3	with the air of one who had offended and knew she was in disgrace but putting one of her little hands in his she looked up pleadingly into his face asking in a slightly tremulous tone dear papa are you angry with me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4683.mp3	i am always displeased when you disobey me elsie he replied very gravely laying his other hand on her head i am very sorry i was naughty papa she said humbly and casting down her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4684.mp3	no sir i did not mean it so and i am very very sorry dear papa please forgive me and i will try never to forget again i think you disobeyed in another matter he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4685.mp3	but i think i will remember not to do it again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4686.mp3	she held up her face for a kiss which he gave i wish i could always be good papa she said but i am naughty so often no said he i think you have been a very good girl for quite a long time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4687.mp3	and elsie found the children in the nursery engaged in eating flora turned to her as she entered please elsie don't be cross she said coaxingly i am real sorry your doll's broken but it wasn't my fault enna would try to snatch it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4688.mp3	and that made it fall and break its head poor elsie this was quite a trial and she could scarcely keep back the tears as following flora's glance she saw her valued doll lying on the window seat

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4690.mp3	followed her to the window never mind dear she said in her pleasant cheery tone patting elsie's cheek and smoothing her hair i've got some excellent glue and i think i can stick it on again and make it almost as good as ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4691.mp3	no indeed he is not mary and he lets me eat everything that he thinks is good for me elsie answered with some warmth she was seated between caroline howard and lucy carrington what did your papa send you away for elsie whispered the latter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4692.mp3	quite unusual with her while the hot tears came into her eyes for she knew very well what was lucy's opinion of her father and more than half suspected that she had been making some unkind remark about him to the others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4693.mp3	and she was eager to remove any unfavorable impression they might have received i am sure he must love you very dearly elsie remarked caroline soothingly no one could help seeing that just by the way he looks at you elsie answered her with a pleased and grateful look
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4694.mp3	whom she did not remember ever to have seen before but who insisted on seating the little girl on the sofa by her side and keeping her there a long while loading her with caresses and flattery my dear child she said what lovely hair you have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4695.mp3	so fine and soft and glossy such a beautiful color too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4696.mp3	natural ringlets i'm sure are they not yes ma'am elsie answered simply wishing from the bottom of her heart that the lady would release her and talk to some one else but the lady had no such intention you are a

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4699.mp3	mister dinsmore to elsie's papa who just then came toward them you ought to be very proud of this child she is the very image of yourself and a perfect little beauty too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4700.mp3	miss stevens is pleased to flatter me he said bowing low but flattery is not good for either grown up children or younger ones and i must beg leave to decline the compliment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4701.mp3	as i cannot see that elsie bears the slightest resemblance to me or any of my family she is very like her mother though he added with a half sigh and a tender loving glance at his little girl and that is just what i would have her

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4703.mp3	rising and sailing out of the room mister dinsmore took the seat she had vacated and passing his arm round his little girl said to her in an undertone my little daughter must not be so foolish as to believe that people mean all they say to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4704.mp3	for some persons talk in a very thoughtless way and without perhaps intending to be exactly untruthful say a great deal that they really do not mean and i should be sorry indeed to see my little girl so spoiled by all this silly flattery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4705.mp3	as to grow up conceited and vain she looked at him with her own sweet innocent smile free from the slightest touch of vanity no papa she said i do not mind when people say such things because i know the bible says

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4711.mp3	no lucy i must obey my father elsie answered in a very pleasant but no less decided tone some one caught her round the waist and lifted her up oh papa she exclaimed i did not know you were there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4712.mp3	and set her down the little girls watched until the last of the party had disappeared down the avenue and then ran gayly up stairs to elsie's room where they busied themselves until tea time in various little preparations for the evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4713.mp3	who passed in and out with an air of mystery and importance and generally laden with some odd looking bundle when going in which they invariably left behind on coming out again and many a whispered consultation had been held as to what was probably going on in there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4714.mp3	elsie and carry seemed to be in the secret but only smiled and shook their heads wisely when questioned but at length tea being over and all both old and young assembled as if by common consent in the drawing room it began to be whispered about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4715.mp3	that their curiosity was now on the point of being gratified
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4716.mp3	and every face brightened with mirth and expectation and when a moment after the doors were thrown open there was a universal burst of applause a large christmas tree had been set up at the further end of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4717.mp3	and with its myriad of lighted tapers and its load of toys and bonbons interspersed with many a richer and more costly gift made quite a display beautiful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4718.mp3	missus dinsmore and adelaide approached the tree and began the pleasant task of distributing the gifts everything was labelled and each as his or her name was called out stepped forward to receive the present no one had been forgotten each had something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4719.mp3	and almost every one had several pretty presents mary leslie and little flora arnott were made perfectly happy with wax dolls that could open and shut their eyes caroline howard received a gold chain from her mamma and a pretty pin from elsie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4720.mp3	because mary leslie's doll was a little larger than hers elsie had already received a pretty bracelet from her aunt adelaide a needle case from lora and several little gifts from her young guests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4721.mp3	and was just beginning to wonder what had become of her papa's promised present when she heard her name again and adelaide turning to her with a pleased look slipped a most beautiful diamond ring on her finger from your papa she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4722.mp3	go and thank him it is well worth it elsie sought him out where he stood alone in a corner an amused spectator of the merry scene see papa she said holding up her hand i think it very beautiful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4723.mp3	thank you dear papa thank you very much does it please you my darling he asked stooping to press a kiss on the little upturned face so bright and happy yes papa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4724.mp3	the very prettiest ring i ever saw yet i think there is something else you would have liked better is there not he asked looking searchingly into her face dear papa i like it very much i would rather have it than anything else on the tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4725.mp3	still you have not answered my question he said with a smile as he sat down and drew her to his side adding in a playful tone come i am not going to put up with any evasion tell me truly if you would have preferred something else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4726.mp3	and if so what it is elsie blushed and looked down then raising her eyes and seeing with what a tender loving glance he was regarding her she took courage to say yes papa there is one thing i would have liked better
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4727.mp3	and that is your miniature to her surprise he looked highly pleased at her reply and giving her another kiss said well darling some day you shall have it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4728.mp3	mister horace dinsmore called adelaide taking some small glittering object from the tree another present for me he asked as walter came running with it he had already received several from his father and sisters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4729.mp3	do you like it papa she asked her face glowing with delight to see how pleased he was yes darling very much and i shall always think of my little girl when i use it keep it in your pocket and use it every day won't you papa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4730.mp3	and he laughed and stroked her hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4731.mp3	not to night to morrow after breakfast you may eat the cream candy and the rock but none of the others they are colored and very unwholesome won't you eat some papa she asked with winning sweetness no dearest he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4732.mp3	for though i too am fond of sweet things i will not eat them while i refuse them to you do papa she urged it would give me pleasure to see you enjoying it no darling i will wait until to morrow too

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4734.mp3	and then as the gifts had all been distributed and the little folks were in high glee a variety of sports were commenced by them in which some of their elders also took a part and thus the hours sped away so rapidly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4735.mp3	that elsie was very much surprised when her father called her to go to bed is it half past nine already papa she asked

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4775.mp3	stopping to question them we found them both well informed as to the railway time tables of the vicinity and the topography of the lower river they told us that the scenery for the next fourteen miles was similar in its dark desolation to that which we had passed through during the day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4776.mp3	also that owing to the great number of islands and the labyrinth of channels both in the rock and on the east side of the mississippi we should find it practically impossible to know when we had reached the latter we should doubtless proceed several miles below the mouth of the rock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4777.mp3	before we noticed that the current was setting persistently south and then would have an exceedingly difficult task in retracing our course and pulling up stream to our destination rock island which is six miles north of the delta of the rock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4778.mp3	they strongly advised our going into rock island by rail the present landing was the last chance to strike a railway except at milan twelve miles below it was now so late that we could not hope to reach milan before dark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4779.mp3	and milan was farther from rock island than either carbon cliff or coloma with less frequent railway service for these and other reasons we decided to accept this advice and to ship from coloma

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4859.mp3	like a brave chick said the old biddy as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused aunt to utter that remark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4860.mp3	the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up give one loud croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs and wings could carry her little speckle remembering the advice

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4866.mp3	so he tried every day to fly and crow and at last managed to get up then how he did strut and rustle his feathers while his playmates sat below and watched him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4867.mp3	you'll fall and get hurt said his sister blot hold your tongue you ugly little thing and don't talk to me i'm going to crow and can't be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen be quiet down there

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4909.mp3	they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with their great bills
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4910.mp3	when fed they gobbled up the fish never stopping to swallow it till the pouches under their bills were full then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4911.mp3	and there found a splendid sight six lions and lionesses in three or four different cages sitting or standing in dignified attitudes and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4912.mp3	one lioness was ill and lay on her bed looking very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4913.mp3	i liked this lion very much for though the biggest he was very gentle and had a noble face the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are some creeping noiselessly to and fro
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4914.mp3	some leaping up and down and some washing their faces with their velvet paws all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4915.mp3	it was a very loud and large purr but no fireside pussy could have done it better and every one laughed at the sound there were pretty spotted leopards panthers and smaller varieties of the same species
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4916.mp3	i sat watching them a long time longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run they seemed so unhappy barred in those small dens suddenly the lions began to roar the tigers to snarl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4917.mp3	and all to get very much excited about something sniffing at the openings thrusting their paws through the bars and lashing their tails impatiently i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4918.mp3	this was their dinner and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous such roars and howls and cries as arose while the man went slowly down the line
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4919.mp3	gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles the lions behaved best for they only paced up and down with an occasional cry but the tigers were quite frantic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4920.mp3	for they tumbled one over the other shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4921.mp3	one lady had a fright for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great claw and he clutched it trying to drag her nearer the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4922.mp3	as if a whole family of wild beasts were after her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4923.mp3	the tigers snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4924.mp3	one little leopard was better bred than the others for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet proper manner which was an example to the rest the lions ate in dignified silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4925.mp3	all but my favourite who carried his share to his sick mate and by every gentle means in his power tried to make her eat she was too ill however and turned away with a plaintive moan which seemed to grieve him sadly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4926.mp3	he wouldn't touch his dinner but lay down near her with the lump between his paws as if guarding it for her and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hunger till his mate could share it with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4927.mp3	as i took a last look at his fine old face i named him douglas and walked away humming to myself the lines of the ballad douglas douglas tender and true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4928.mp3	as a contrast to the wild beasts i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine large house all to themselves here was every variety from the great ugly chimpanzee to the funny little fellows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4929.mp3	who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers a mamma sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the gray monkey with the blue nose scolded at me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4930.mp3	he was a cross old party and sat huddled up in the straw scowling at every one like an ill tempered old bachelor half a dozen little ones teased him capitally by dropping bits of bread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4931.mp3	nut shells and straws down on him from above as they climbed about the perches or swung by their tails one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail i'm afraid the gray one bit it off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4932.mp3	and kept trying to swing like the others forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with he would run up the bare boughs and give a jump expecting to catch and swing but the lame tail wouldn't hold him and down he'd go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4933.mp3	bounce on to the straw at first he'd sit and stare about him as if much amazed to find himself there then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently which seemed to delight the other monkeys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4934.mp3	and finally he'd examine his poor little tail and appear to understand the misfortune which had befallen him the funny expression of his face was irresistible and i enjoyed seeing him very much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4935.mp3	and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away the snake house came next and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoceros family i rather like snakes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4936.mp3	since i had a tame green one who lived under the door step and would come out and play with me on sunny days these snakes i found very interesting only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out and i wasn't allowed to poke them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4937.mp3	and blinked at me through the glass looking quite as dangerous as he was there were big and little snakes black brown and speckled lively and lazy pretty and plain ones but i liked the great boa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4938.mp3	best when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree such as i had seen in other cages for the snakes to wind up and down where is he i wonder i hope he hasn't got
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4939.mp3	out i said to myself thinking of a story i read once of a person in a menagerie who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding towards him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4940.mp3	as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me the branch began to move all at once and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the boa's glittering eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4941.mp3	and lay so still i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me a very villainous looking reptile he was and i felt grateful that i didn't live in a country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4942.mp3	where such unpleasant neighbours might pop in upon you unexpectedly he was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size which seemed immense as he stretched himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4943.mp3	and then knotted his rough grayish body into a great loop with the fiery eyed head in the middle he was not one of the largest kind but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4944.mp3	which i hadn't the heart to stay and see him devour alive i was walking toward the camel's pagoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face it's the boa i thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4945.mp3	much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way which i certainly had done with all speed picking myself out of the hedge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4946.mp3	i walked beside him examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent eye i'm very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4947.mp3	hoping to find something eatable i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees flocks of snow white cranes stalking over the grass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4948.mp3	on their long scarlet legs striped zebras racing in their paddock queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches pretty antelopes chasing one another

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4950.mp3	and came at the keeper's call to kiss him and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish it was very like a seal only much larger and had four fins instead of two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4951.mp3	its eyes were lovely so dark and soft and liquid but its mouth was not pretty and i declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/4953.mp3	he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5021.mp3	and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshipped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5022.mp3	and with costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel who in these days made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5023.mp3	missus ludlow sacrificed as i say to paris yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5024.mp3	missus ludlow's mental motions were sufficiently various
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5025.mp3	which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own at another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5026.mp3	on the whole as i have said she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5027.mp3	isabel had developed less however than lily had thought likely development to lily's understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5028.mp3	the trophies lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague but this was exactly what she had expected of isabel to give it form and body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5029.mp3	we know ourselves that isabel had made conquests whether inferior or not to those she might have effected in her native land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5030.mp3	than that she didn't wish to speak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5031.mp3	but lily knew nothing of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti climax an impression confirmed by the fact that isabel's silence about mister osmond for instance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5032.mp3	was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts as this happened very often it sometimes appeared to missus ludlow that she had lost her courage so uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5033.mp3	it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabel watched the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5034.mp3	the early dusk of a november afternoon had already closed in the street lamps in the thick brown air looked weak and red
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5035.mp3	and euston square was a long way from piccadilly but isabel performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5036.mp3	set her right again she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streets the moving crowds the hurrying cabs the lighted shops the flaring stalls the dark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5037.mp3	she made her way down to rome without touching at florence

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5039.mp3	and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mister bantling that he would soon come over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5040.mp3	had not been a fortnight in rome before she proposed to madame merle that they should make a little pilgrimage to the east madame merle remarked that her friend was restless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5041.mp3	but she added that she herself had always been consumed with the desire to visit athens and constantinople the two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey in egypt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5042.mp3	isabel found much to interest her in these countries though madame merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5043.mp3	her character had revealed itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5044.mp3	a consummation the more desirable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5045.mp3	she considered with the presumption of youth that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5046.mp3	an occasional lapse from candour in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5047.mp3	and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5048.mp3	advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5049.mp3	but it stood for a high water mark in the ebb and flow of confidence madame merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5050.mp3	a stationary affection in other words was impossible it must move one way or the other however that might be the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic which was more active than it had ever been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5051.mp3	i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo or as she stood among the broken columns of the acropolis and fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the strait of salamis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5052.mp3	deep and memorable as these emotions had remained she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome a few days after her arrival
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5053.mp3	during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame merle in whose house she had gone to lodge made it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5054.mp3	and went to pay a visit at palazzo crescentini madame merle on this occasion remaining in rome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5055.mp3	the day after the cutters left antonia came over to see us grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted you've got something on your mind antonia she said anxiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5056.mp3	she hesitated and then told us how strangely mister cutter had behaved before he went away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5057.mp3	as he had just put a new yale lock on the front door cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5058.mp3	or the way he looked at her i feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5059.mp3	grandmother was apprehensive at once i don't think it's right for you to stay there feeling that way i suppose it would n't be right for you to leave the place alone either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5060.mp3	maybe jim would be willing to go over there and sleep and you could come here nights i'd feel safer knowing you were under my own roof i guess jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5061.mp3	antonia turned to me eagerly oh would you jim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5062.mp3	the third night i spent at the cutters i awoke suddenly with the impression that i had heard a door open and shut everything was still however and i must have gone to sleep again immediately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5063.mp3	i was only half awake but i decided that he might take the cutters silver whoever he was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5064.mp3	i held my breath and lay absolutely still a hand closed softly on my shoulder and at the same moment i felt something hairy and cologne scented brushing my face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5065.mp3	the man became insane he stood over me choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse so this is what she's up to when i'm away is it where is she you nasty whelp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5066.mp3	where is she under the bed are you hussy i know your tricks wait till i get at you i'll fix this rat you've got in here he's caught all right so long as cutter had me by the throat there was no chance for me at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5067.mp3	when i got home i climbed in at the kitchen window i was covered with blood from my nose and lip but i was too sick to do anything about it i found a shawl and an overcoat on the hatrack lay down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts went to sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5068.mp3	her cry of fright awakened me truly i was a battered object as she helped me to my room i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror my lip was cut and stood out like a snout my nose looked like a big blue plum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5069.mp3	and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discolored grandmother said we must have the doctor at once but i implored her as i had never begged for anything before not to send for him i could stand anything i told her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5070.mp3	she seemed to understand though i was too faint and miserable to go into explanations when she took
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5071.mp3	she spent the whole morning bathing and poulticing me and rubbing me with arnica i heard antonia sobbing outside my door but i asked grandmother to send her away i felt that i never wanted to see her again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5072.mp3	she had let me in for all this disgustingness grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that i had been there instead of antonia but i lay with my disfigured face to the wall and felt no particular gratitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5073.mp3	if the story once got abroad i would never hear the last of it i could well imagine what the old men down at the drug store would do with such a theme
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5074.mp3	and had left again on the six o'clock train for denver that morning the agent said his face was striped with court plaster and he carried his left hand in a sling he looked so used up that the agent asked him what had happened to him since ten o'clock the night before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5075.mp3	my own garments had been treated so badly that i never saw them again grandmother burned them in the cutters kitchen range while antonia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it the front door bell rang violently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5076.mp3	there stood missus cutter locked out for she had no key to the new lock her head trembling with rage i advised her to control herself or she would have a stroke grandmother said afterwards
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5077.mp3	antonia was frightened and was going home to stay for a while she told missus cutter it would be useless to interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened then missus cutter told her story
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5078.mp3	she and her husband had started home from omaha together the morning before they had to stop over several hours at waymore junction to catch the black hawk train
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5079.mp3	when he returned he told her that he would have to stay overnight there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5080.mp3	she saw him slip a twenty dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket that bill she said should have aroused her suspicions at once but did not the trains are never called at little junction towns everybody knows when they come in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5081.mp3	mister cutter showed his wife's ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5082.mp3	and that cutter must have planned it so the conductor told her the black hawk train was due at waymore twelve minutes after the kansas city train left she saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to black hawk without her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5083.mp3	she had no choice but to go on to kansas city and take the first fast train for home cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices he could have left her in the omaha hotel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5084.mp3	but apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible mister cutter will pay for this missus burden he will pay missus cutter avouched nodding her horselike head and rolling her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5085.mp3	certainly cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil in some way he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her hysterical nature perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife's rage and amazement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5086.mp3	than from any experiences of his own his zest in debauchery might wane but never missus cutter's belief in it the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5087.mp3	the cavaliers looked up and saw that what planchet had announced to them was true ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the rue de lyon on the opposite side of the hostelry of the beau paon a high hedge of bushy elders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5088.mp3	hawthorn and wild hops formed an impenetrable fence behind which rose a white house with a high tiled roof
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5089.mp3	between the two a small door with a porch supported by a couple of pillars formed the entrance to the house the door was gained by a step raised a little from the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5090.mp3	on second thoughts he took hold of his horse by the bridle and led it about thirty paces further on his two companions following him he then advanced about another thirty paces until he arrived at the door of a cart house lighted by an iron grating and lifting up a wooden latch pushed open one of the folding doors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5091.mp3	he entered first leading his horse after him by the bridle into a small courtyard where an odor met them which revealed their close vicinity to a stable that smells all right said porthos loudly getting off his horse and i almost begin to think
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5092.mp3	pierrefonds i have only one cow planchet hastened to say modestly and i have thirty said porthos or rather i don't exactly know how many i have when the two cavaliers had entered planchet fastened the door behind them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5093.mp3	in the meantime d'artagnan who had dismounted with his usual agility inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight a parisian feels at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5094.mp3	porthos clawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into the ground and ate or rather browsed upon them shells and all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5095.mp3	and dressed in an old stable suit of clothes the peasant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5096.mp3	oh they shall have as much as they like gently gently my man said d'artagnan we are getting on a little too fast a few oats and a good bed nothing more some bran and water for my horse said porthos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5097.mp3	and came out into a little garden behind the house the principal front of which as we have already noticed faced the street as they approached
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5098.mp3	this room softly lighted by a lamp placed on the table seemed from the end of the garden like a smiling image of repose comfort and happiness in every direction where the rays of light fell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5099.mp3	whether upon a piece of old china or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness or upon the weapons hanging against the wall the soft light was softly reflected and its rays seemed to linger everywhere upon something or another agreeable to the eye the lamp which lighted the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5100.mp3	whilst the foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the window frames splendidly illuminated a damask table cloth as white as snow the table was laid for two persons amber colored wine sparkled in a long cut glass bottle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5101.mp3	near the table in a high backed armchair reclined fast asleep a woman of about thirty years of age her face the very picture of health and freshness upon her knees lay a large cat with her paws folded under her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5102.mp3	and her eyes half closed purring in that significant manner which according to feline habits indicates perfect contentment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5103.mp3	at the sound of this gigantic voice the cat took flight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5104.mp3	introduced his two companions into the room where the table was already laid permit me my dear he said to present to you monsieur le chevalier d'artagnan my patron
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5105.mp3	monsieur le baron du vallon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5106.mp3	porthos bowed with a reverence which anne of austria would have approved of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5107.mp3	and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady in question not however
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5108.mp3	frankly conceded d'artagnan complimented planchet and said you are indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable life monsieur said planchet laughing is capital which a man ought to invest as sensibly as he possibly can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5109.mp3	planchet turned to his housekeeper you have before you he said to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5110.mp3	and about two others as well said the lady with a very decided flemish accent madame is dutch inquired d'artagnan porthos curled his mustache a circumstance which was not lost upon d'artagnan who noticed everything i am from antwerp said the lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5111.mp3	you should not call her madame said d'artagnan why not asked planchet because it would make her seem older every time you call her so well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5112.mp3	and a very pretty name too said porthos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5113.mp3	she ran away from a brute of a husband who was in the habit of beating her being myself a picard born i was always very fond of the artesian women and it is only a step from artois to flanders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5114.mp3	she placed her two thousand florins in my establishment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5115.mp3	and which have brought her in ten thousand bravo planchet she is free and well off she has a cow a maid servant and old celestin at her orders she mends my linen knits my winter stockings she only sees me every fortnight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5116.mp3	a meal into a regular feast fresh butter salt beef anchovies tunny a shopful of planchet's commodities fowls vegetables salad fish from the pond and the river game from the forest all the produce in fact of the province
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5117.mp3	the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of dust which covered them porthos's heart began to expand as he said i am hungry and he sat himself beside madame truchen whom he looked at in the most killing manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5118.mp3	do not trouble yourselves he said if truchen should leave the table now and then during supper for she will have to look after your bedrooms in fact the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently and they could hear on the first floor above them the creaking of the wooden bedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5119.mp3	d'artagnan still preserved his dignity and self possession but porthos had lost a portion of his and the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5120.mp3	recommended a new descent into the cellar and as planchet no longer walked with the steadiness of a well trained foot soldier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5121.mp3	they set off humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5122.mp3	while the two wine bibbers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5123.mp3	porthos fancies himself at la rochelle thought d'artagnan as they returned freighted with bottles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5124.mp3	d'artagnan whom nothing ever escaped remarked how much redder truchen's left cheek was than her right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5125.mp3	and truchen was looking at him with a most bewitching smile the sparkling wine of anjou very soon produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5126.mp3	after his friend had undressed him d'artagnan got into his own bed saying to himself mordioux
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5127.mp3	no one in the house was capable of taking the slightest notice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5128.mp3	like a kind good housekeeper it was still perfectly dark then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5129.mp3	he took by assault porthos's room which was next to his own the worthy porthos was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder in the dim obscurity of the room his gigantic frame was prominently displayed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5130.mp3	and his swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5131.mp3	the whole household was already up the cook was mercilessly slaughtering in the poultry yard celestin was gathering white cherries in the garden porthos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5132.mp3	brisk and lively as ever held out his hand to planchet's and d'artagnan requested permission to embrace madame truchen the latter to show that she bore no ill will approached porthos upon whom she conferred the same favor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5133.mp3	took both his friends by the hand i am going to show you over the house he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5134.mp3	i am a great stickler for a good view myself said porthos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5135.mp3	i have had four avenues laid out and at the end of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5136.mp3	and he led his two guests to a window ah said d'artagnan this is the rue de lyon yes i have two windows on this side a paltry insignificant view
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5137.mp3	for there is always that bustling and noisy inn which is a very disagreeable neighbor i had four windows here but i bricked up two let us go on said d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5138.mp3	it is the horizon a thick line of green which is yellow in the spring green in the summer red in the autumn and white in the winter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5139.mp3	i assure you it is very curious hardly a day passes that some one is not buried there for fontainebleau is by no means an inconsiderable place sometimes we see young girls clothed in white carrying banners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5140.mp3	and then too we see some of the officers of the king's household i should not like that said porthos there is not much amusement in it at all events said d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5141.mp3	if i had any i should be far from rejecting them said planchet but possessing only this little cemetery full of flowers so moss grown shady and quiet i am contented with it and i think of those who live in town in the rue des lombards for instance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5142.mp3	and who have to listen to the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day and to the soulless tramp tramp tramp of a hundred and fifty thousand foot passengers but living said porthos living remember that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5143.mp3	why i feel it does me good to contemplate a few dead upon my word said d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5144.mp3	monsieur said planchet i am one of those good humored sort of men whom heaven created for the purpose of living a certain span of days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5145.mp3	we are going to have a representation now for i think i heard something like chanting yes said d'artagnan i hear singing too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5146.mp3	the officiating priest the beadle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5147.mp3	no no one seems to be following the coffin yes said porthos i see a man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5148.mp3	i find it interesting said d'artagnan leaning on the window sill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5149.mp3	it is exactly my own case i was so melancholy at first that i could do nothing but make the sign of the cross all day and the chants were like so many nails being driven into my head but now they lull me to sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5150.mp3	what said porthos to d'artagnan as he turned round are you going to remain here yes i will join you presently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5151.mp3	not yet ah yes the grave digger is waiting until the cords are fastened round the bier but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5152.mp3	leave me leave me i feel i am beginning already to be much comforted by my meditations so do not interrupt me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5153.mp3	the two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which they carried the litter and were letting their burden glide gently into the open grave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5154.mp3	the grave having been filled up the priests turned away and the grave digger having addressed a few words to them followed them as they moved away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5155.mp3	it is aramis himself aramis in fact remained alone on that side at least for hardly had he turned his head when a woman's footsteps and the rustling of her dress were heard in the path close to him he immediately turned round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5156.mp3	yes he added after a pause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5157.mp3	either by way of attack or defense that they must be conversing about any other subject than of love at the end of the conversation the lady rose and bowed profoundly to aramis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5158.mp3	the cavalier kneels at the beginning the young lady by and by gets tamed down and then it is she who has to supplicate who is this lady i would give anything to ascertain this seemed impossible however for aramis was the first to leave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5159.mp3	i must and will learn who that woman is said the musketeer again and then without further deliberation he set off in pursuit of her as he was going along he tried to think how he could possibly contrive to make her raise her veil she is not young he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5160.mp3	and is a woman of high rank in society i ought to know that figure and peculiar style of walk as he ran the sound of his spurs and of his boots upon the hard ground of the street made a strange jingling noise a fortunate circumstance in itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5161.mp3	which he was far from reckoning upon the noise disturbed the lady she seemed to fancy she was being either followed or pursued which was indeed the case and turned round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5162.mp3	he murmured madame de chevreuse d'artagnan would not go home until he had learnt everything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5163.mp3	a poor franciscan mendicant friar replied the latter who had not even a dog to love him in this world and to accompany him to his last resting place if that were really the case thought d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5164.mp3	would be one of the privileged travelers and as the plume in porthos's hat made the wooden candles suspended over the front jingle together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5165.mp3	for the morrow but the grocer had a heart of gold ever mindful of the good old times a trait that carries youth into old age so planchet notwithstanding a sort of internal shiver checked as soon as experienced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5166.mp3	received porthos with respect mingled with the tenderest cordiality porthos who was a little cold and stiff in his manners at first on account of the social difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer soon began to soften when he perceived so much good feeling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5167.mp3	and into the drawers full of sweetmeats
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5168.mp3	where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose detected the delicious figs from provence filberts from the forest tours plums were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five consecutive hours his teeth like millstones cracked heaps of nuts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5169.mp3	the shells of which were scattered all over the floor where they were trampled by every one who went in and out of the shop porthos pulled from the stalk with his lips at one mouthful bunches of the rich muscatel raisins with their beautiful bloom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5170.mp3	at each other without venturing to open their lips they did not know who porthos was for they had never seen him before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5171.mp3	had already begun to disappear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5172.mp3	he will very soon have none at all to do if this sort of thing continues grumbled the foreman who had planchet's word that he should be his successor in the midst of his despair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5173.mp3	he approached porthos who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to the shop itself he hoped that porthos would rise and that this movement would distract his devouring ideas what do you want my man asked porthos affably
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5174.mp3	i should like to pass you monsieur if it is not troubling you too much very well said porthos it does not trouble me in the least at the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband lifted him off the ground and placed him very gently on the other side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5175.mp3	smiling all the while with the same affable expression as soon as porthos had placed him on the ground the lad's legs so shook under him that he fell back upon some sacks of corks but noticing the giant's gentleness of manner he ventured again and said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5176.mp3	yes but if raisins nuts and almonds are heating there is no doubt at all of it monsieur honey is very cooling said porthos stretching out his hand toward a small barrel of honey which was open and he plunged the scoop with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5177.mp3	the foreman clasped his hands together the two others got under the counters fearing porthos might have a taste for human flesh we shall only take a sort of snack here said d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5178.mp3	so much the better you overwhelm me monsieur le baron the monsieur le baron had a great effect upon the men who detected a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind this title too reassured them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5179.mp3	they had never heard that an ogre was ever called monsieur le baron i will take a few biscuits to eat on the road said porthos carelessly and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge pocket of his doublet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5180.mp3	my shop is saved exclaimed planchet yes as the cheese was whispered the foreman what cheese the dutch cheese inside which a rat had made his way and we found only the rind left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5181.mp3	where it had just been announced that some refreshment was prepared alas thought the grocer addressing a look at d'artagnan full of entreaty which the latter half understood as soon as they had finished eating they set off it was late
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5182.mp3	when the three riders who had left paris about six in the evening arrived at fontainebleau
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5183.mp3	and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows his woods and his rabbit warrens porthos had all the taste and pride of a landed proprietor when d'artagnan saw his two companions in earnest conversation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5184.mp3	separated himself from the whole world as he had done from porthos and from planchet the moon shone softly through the foliage of the forest the breezes of the open country rose deliciously perfumed to the horse's nostrils and they snorted and pranced along delightedly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5185.mp3	in the beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees and where he had played under the green apple trees covered with red cheeked fruit he went on to say that he had solemnly promised himself that as soon as he should have made his fortune he would return to nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5186.mp3	how so why you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5187.mp3	what is it inquired porthos looking all round him as if in search of the circumstance that annoyed planchet and desirous of freeing him from it why formerly said the grocer you used to call me planchet quite short
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5188.mp3	and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner than you do now certainly certainly i should have said so formerly replied the good natured porthos with an embarrassment full of delicacy but formerly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5189.mp3	so that monsieur le baron continued the grocer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5190.mp3	if that be the case my dear planchet i will do so certainly replied porthos and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5191.mp3	but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5192.mp3	which made the animal's legs almost give way d'artagnan burst out laughing as he said take care planchet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5193.mp3	oh said planchet mousqueton is not dead and yet monsieur le baron is very fond of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5194.mp3	and i was only saying this very morning to d'artagnan how much i regretted him but tell me planchet thank you monsieur le baron thank you good lad good lad how many acres of park have you got of park
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5195.mp3	whereabouts monsieur at your chateau oh monsieur le baron i have neither chateau nor park nor meadows nor woods what have you got then inquired porthos and why do you call it a country seat i did not call it a country seat monsieur le baron
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5196.mp3	replied planchet somewhat humiliated but a country box ah ah i understand you are modest no monsieur le baron i speak the plain truth i have rooms for a couple of friends that's all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5197.mp3	in the first place they can walk about the king's forest which is very beautiful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5198.mp3	nearly as beautiful as my forest at berry planchet opened his eyes very wide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5199.mp3	because i don't know where it ends and also because it is full of poachers how can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you because they hunt my game and i hunt them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5200.mp3	which in these peaceful times is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small scale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5201.mp3	and exceedingly unhappy in fact d'artagnan d'artagnan we say for we must call him by his name to remind our readers of his existence d'artagnan we repeat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5202.mp3	had absolutely nothing whatever to do amidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion after following the king during two whole days at fontainebleau
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5203.mp3	the musketeer felt that he needed something more than this to satisfy the cravings of his nature at every moment assailed by people asking him how do you think this costume suits me monsieur d'artagnan he would reply to them in quiet sarcastic tones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5204.mp3	why i think you are quite as well dressed as the
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5205.mp3	it was just such a compliment d'artagnan would choose where he did not feel disposed to pay any other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5206.mp3	whenever any one asked him how do you intend to dress yourself this evening he replied i shall undress myself at which the ladies all laughed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5207.mp3	and also to receive in exchange d'artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of private business at the moment d'artagnan made his request
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5208.mp3	quite exhausted from dancing you wish to leave me monsieur d'artagnan inquired the king with an air of astonishment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5209.mp3	any one who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave him sire said d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5210.mp3	ah if i could only hold the balancing pole while you were dancing it would be a very different affair but my dear monsieur d'artagnan said the king gravely people dance without balancing poles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5211.mp3	ah indeed said the musketeer continuing his imperceptible tone of irony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5212.mp3	therefore at fontainebleau for to do so would be useless but with the permission of our readers follow him to the rue des lombards where he was located at the sign of the pilon d'or
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5213.mp3	and the weather was exceedingly warm there was only one window open and that one belonging to a room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5214.mp3	a perfume of spices mingled with another perfume less exotic but more penetrating namely that which arose from the street ascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer d'artagnan reclining in an immense straight backed chair with his legs not stretched out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5215.mp3	but simply placed upon a stool formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be seen both his arms were crossed over his head his head reclining upon his left shoulder like alexander the great his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5216.mp3	usually so quick and intelligent in their expression were now half closed and seemed fastened as it were upon a small corner of blue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5217.mp3	there was just enough blue and no more to fill one of the sacks of lentils or haricots which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the ground floor thus extended at his ease and sheltered in his place of observation behind the window d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5218.mp3	seemed as if he had ceased to be a soldier as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the palace but was on the contrary a quiet easy going citizen in a state of stagnation between his dinner and supper or between his supper and his bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5219.mp3	while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed and the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch could be heard retreating d'artagnan continued however to think of nothing except the blue corner of the sky a few paces from him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5220.mp3	and his eyes fixed on d'artagnan who was either thinking dreaming or sleeping with his eyes open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5221.mp3	but d'artagnan did not stir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5222.mp3	after a prolonged reflection on the subject the most ingenious means that suggested itself to him under the present circumstances was to let himself roll off the sack on to the floor murmuring at the same time against himself the word stupid but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5223.mp3	notwithstanding the noise produced by planchet's fall d'artagnan who had in the course of his existence heard many other and very different falls did not appear to pay the least attention to the present one besides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5224.mp3	and yet planchet fancied that in token of tacit approval he saw him imperceptibly smile at the word stupid this emboldened him to say are you asleep monsieur d'artagnan no planchet i am not even asleep replied the musketeer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5225.mp3	i am in despair said planchet to hear such a word as even well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5226.mp3	of course monsieur d'artagnan well well then the word distresses me beyond measure tell me why you are distressed planchet said d'artagnan if you say that you are not even asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5227.mp3	planchet you know that i am never bored except to day and the day before yesterday bah monsieur d'artagnan it is a week since you returned here from fontainebleau
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5228.mp3	in other words you have no longer your orders to issue or your men to review and maneuver you need the sound of guns drums and all that din and confusion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5229.mp3	when you were there when we both were there a certain arab
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5230.mp3	he was a clever fellow although of a very odd complexion which was the same color as your olives well this arab whenever he had done eating or working used to sit down to rest himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5231.mp3	as i am resting myself now and smoked i cannot tell you what sort of magical leaves in a large amber mouthed tube
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5232.mp3	better to sit down than to stand up to lie down than to sit down to be dead than to lie down he was an acutely melancholy arab and i remember him perfectly well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5233.mp3	he used to cut off the heads of protestants with the most singular gusto precisely and then used to embalm them when they were worth the trouble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5234.mp3	he looked like a basket maker making baskets you are quite right planchet he did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5235.mp3	i have no doubt of it but what do you think of his mode of reasoning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5236.mp3	in point of fact then better to sit down than to stand up is plain enough especially when one may be fatigued and planchet smiled in a roguish way as for better to be lying down let that pass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5237.mp3	it is in my opinion very absurd my own undoubted preference being for my bed and if you are not of my opinion it is simply as i have already had the honor of telling you because you are boring yourself to death planchet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5238.mp3	exactly well then i am like his hare he has got a hare also then he has all sorts of animals well what does his hare do then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5239.mp3	thinks ah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5240.mp3	and yet monsieur you have a look out upon the street yes and wonderfully interesting that is of course but it is no less true monsieur that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5241.mp3	ah planchet my friend returned d'artagnan you are getting ambitious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5242.mp3	what happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than i can tell i felt myself hurled into the waves and if i escaped from death and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5243.mp3	it was because the powerful arm of hans came to my rescue the brave icelander carried me out of the reach of the waves over a burning sand where i found myself by the side of my uncle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5244.mp3	then he returned to the rocks against which the furious waves were beating to save what he could i was unable to speak i was shattered with fatigue and excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5245.mp3	i wanted a whole hour to recover even a little but a deluge of rain was still falling though with that violence which generally denotes the near cessation of a storm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5246.mp3	the next day the weather was splendid the sky and the sea had sunk into sudden repose every trace of the awful storm had disappeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5247.mp3	the exhilarating voice of the professor fell upon my ears as i awoke he was ominously cheerful well my boy he cried have you slept well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5248.mp3	and that i was only just coming down to breakfast and that i was to be married to graeuben that day alas if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east we should have passed under germany under my beloved town of hamburg
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5249.mp3	under the very street where dwelt all that i loved most in the world then only forty leagues would have separated us but they were forty leagues perpendicular of solid granite wall and in reality we were a thousand leagues asunder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5250.mp3	all these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before i could answer my uncle's question well now he repeated won't you tell me how you have slept oh very well i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5251.mp3	i am only a little knocked up but i shall soon be better oh says my uncle that's nothing to signify you are only a little bit tired but you uncle you seem in very good spirits this morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5252.mp3	but my dear uncle do let me ask you one question of course axel how about returning returning why you are talking about the return before the arrival no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5253.mp3	i only want to know how that is to be managed in the simplest way possible when we have reached the centre of the globe either we shall find some new way to get back or we shall come back like decent folks the way we came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5254.mp3	i feel pleased at the thought that it is sure not to be shut against us but then we shall have to refit the raft of course then as to provisions have we enough to last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5255.mp3	yes to be sure we have hans is a clever fellow and i am sure he must have saved a large part of our cargo but still let us go and make sure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5256.mp3	we left this grotto which lay open to every wind at the same time i cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well it seemed to me impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have destroyed everything on board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5257.mp3	on my arrival on the shore i found hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good order my uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude this man with almost superhuman devotion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5258.mp3	and had saved the most precious of the articles at the risk of his life not that we had suffered no losses for instance our firearms but we might do without them our stock of powder had remained uninjured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5259.mp3	after having risked blowing up during the storm well cried the professor as we have no guns we cannot hunt that's all yes but how about the instruments here is the aneroid the most useful of all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5260.mp3	and for which i would have given all the others by means of it i can calculate the depth and know when we have reached the centre without it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5261.mp3	such high spirits as these were rather too strong but where is the compass i asked here it is upon this rock in perfect condition as well as the thermometers and the chronometer the hunter is a splendid fellow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5262.mp3	there was no denying it we had all our instruments as for tools and appliances there they all lay on the ground ladders ropes picks spades et cetera still there was the question of provisions to be settled and i asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5263.mp3	how are we off for provisions the boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore in a perfect state of preservation for the most part the sea had spared them and what with biscuits salt meat spirits and salt fish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5264.mp3	four months cried the professor we have time to go and to return
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5265.mp3	i ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's ways yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me now said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5266.mp3	therefore we shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst as for the raft i will recommend hans to do his best to repair it although i don't expect it will be of any further use to us how so i cried an idea of my own my lad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5267.mp3	i don't think we shall come out by the way that we went in i stared at the professor with a good deal of mistrust i asked was he not touched in the brain and yet there was method in his madness and now let us go to breakfast said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5268.mp3	i followed him to a headland after he had given his instructions to the hunter there preserved meat biscuit and tea made us an excellent meal one of the best i ever remember hunger the fresh air the calm quiet weather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5269.mp3	after the commotions we had gone through all contributed to give me a good appetite whilst breakfasting i took the opportunity to put to my uncle the question where we were now that seems to me i said rather difficult to make out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5270.mp3	yes it is difficult he said to calculate exactly perhaps even impossible since during these three stormy days i have been unable to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft but still we may get an approximation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5271.mp3	the last observation i remarked was made on the island when the geyser was you mean axel island don't decline the honour of having given your name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the globe well said i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5272.mp3	let it be axel island then we had cleared two hundred and seventy leagues of sea and we were six hundred leagues from iceland very well answered my uncle let us start from that point and count four days storm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5273.mp3	surely axel it may vie in size with the mediterranean itself especially i replied if it happens that we have only crossed it in its narrowest part and it is a curious circumstance i added that if my computations are right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5274.mp3	that is a good long way my friend but whether we are under turkey or the atlantic depends very much upon the question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5275.mp3	perhaps we have deviated no i think not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5276.mp3	well replied my uncle we may easily ascertain this by consulting the compass let us go and see what it says the professor moved towards the rock upon which hans had laid down the instruments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5277.mp3	he was gay and full of spirits he rubbed his hands he studied his attitudes i followed him curious to know if i was right in my estimate as soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle took the compass laid it horizontally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5278.mp3	and questioned the needle which after a few oscillations presently assumed a fixed position my uncle looked and looked and looked again he rubbed his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5279.mp3	and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery what is the matter i asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5280.mp3	an exclamation of astonishment burst from me the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea i shook the box examined it again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5281.mp3	it was in perfect condition in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5282.mp3	we had gone backwards instead of forwards but my uncle rapidly recovered himself aha will fate play tricks upon me will the elements lay plots against me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5283.mp3	shall fire air and water make a combined attack against me well they shall know what a determined man can do i will not yield i will not stir a single foot backwards and it will be seen whether man or nature is to have the upper hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5284.mp3	erect upon the rock angry and threatening otto liedenbrock was a rather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce achilles defying the lightning but i thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5285.mp3	just listen to me i said firmly ambition must have a limit somewhere we cannot perform impossibilities we are not at all fit for another sea voyage who would dream of undertaking a voyage of five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5286.mp3	with a blanket in rags for a sail a stick for a mast and fierce winds in our teeth we cannot steer we shall be buffeted by the tempests and we should be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5287.mp3	i was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten minutes without interruption not that the professor was paying any respectful attention to his nephew's arguments but because he was deaf to all my eloquence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5288.mp3	to the raft he shouted such was his only reply it was no use for me to entreat supplicate get angry or do anything else in the way of opposition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5289.mp3	hans was finishing the repairs of the raft one would have thought that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions with a few more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5290.mp3	a sail already hung from the new mast and the wind was playing in its waving folds the professor said a few words to the guide and immediately he put everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5291.mp3	the air was clear and the north west wind blew steadily what could i do could i stand against the two it was impossible if hans had but taken my side but no it was not to be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5292.mp3	the icelander seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget and deny himself i could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised as it were to his master my only course was to proceed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5293.mp3	i was therefore going with as much resignation as i could find to resume my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle laid his hand upon my shoulder we shall not sail until to morrow he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5294.mp3	i will not leave it until i have examined it to understand what followed it must be borne in mind that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5295.mp3	we were not really where the professor supposed we were in fact we were not upon the north shore of the sea now let us start upon fresh discoveries i said and leaving hans to his work we started off together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5296.mp3	the space between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable it took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock we trampled under our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed in the earliest ages of the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5297.mp3	i also saw immense carapaces more than fifteen feet in diameter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5298.mp3	and ridged up in successive lines i was therefore led to the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the ground on which we were treading on the loose and scattered rocks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5299.mp3	the waves had left manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone this might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe but in my opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5300.mp3	this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within the interior of the earth and it certainly had its origin in the waters of the ocean overhead which had made their way hither through some fissure yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5301.mp3	it must be believed that that fissure is now closed and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a very short time perhaps even this water subjected to the fierce action of central heat had partly been resolved into vapour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5302.mp3	and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests within the bowels of the earth this theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to me for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5303.mp3	fixed physical laws will or may always explain them we were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil the deposits of the waters of former ages the professor was carefully examining every little fissure in the rocks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5304.mp3	wherever he saw a hole he always wanted to know the depth of it to him this was important we had traversed the shores of the liedenbrock sea for a mile when we observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil it seemed upset contorted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5305.mp3	where the remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together huge mounds of bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance they undulated away to the limits of the horizon and melted in the distance in a faint
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5306.mp3	haze there within three square miles were accumulated the materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages a history scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5307.mp3	but an impatient curiosity impelled our steps crackling and rattling our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric animals and interesting fossils the possession of which is a matter of rivalry and contention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5308.mp3	a thousand cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection i stood amazed my uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5309.mp3	his mouth gaping wide his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles his head balancing with an up and down motion his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5310.mp3	leptotheria mericotheria lophiodia anoplotheria megatheria mastodons protopithecae pterodactyles and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5311.mp3	fancy an enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous alexandrian library burnt by omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle professor liedenbrock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5312.mp3	but more was to come when
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5313.mp3	he laid his hand upon a bare skull and cried with a voice trembling with excitement axel axel a human head a human skull i cried no less astonished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5314.mp3	chapter thirty eight the professor in his chair again to understand this apostrophe of my uncle's made to absent french savants it will be necessary to allude to an event of high importance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5315.mp3	in a palaeontological point of view which had occurred a little while before our departure on the twenty eighth of march eighteen sixty three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5316.mp3	near abbeville in the department of somme found a human jawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface it was the first fossil of this nature that had ever been brought to light not far distant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5317.mp3	were found stone hatchets and flint arrow heads stained and encased by lapse of time with a uniform coat of rust the noise of this discovery was very great not in france alone but in england and in germany
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5318.mp3	saw at once the importance of this discovery proved to demonstration the genuineness of the bone in question and became the most ardent defendants in what the english called this trial of a jawbone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5319.mp3	therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5320.mp3	and agreeing in that with cuvier he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the quaternary period my uncle liedenbrock along with the great body of the geologists had maintained his ground disputed and argued until
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5321.mp3	we knew all these details but we were not aware that since our departure the question had advanced to farther stages other similar maxillaries though belonging to individuals of various types and different nations were found in the loose grey soil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5322.mp3	of certain grottoes in france switzerland and belgium as well as weapons tools earthen utensils bones of children and adults the existence therefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more certain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5323.mp3	nor was this all fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human species to a higher antiquity still it is true that these remains were not human bones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5324.mp3	but objects bearing the traces of his handiwork such as fossil leg bones of animals sculptured and carved evidently by the hand of man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5325.mp3	he was a predecessor of the mastodon he was a contemporary of the southern elephant he lived a hundred thousand years ago when according to geologists the pleiocene formation was in progress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5326.mp3	such then was the state of palaeontological science and what we knew of it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this stupendous golgotha any one may now understand the frenzied excitement of my uncle when
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5327.mp3	twenty yards farther on he found himself face to face with a primitive man it was a perfectly recognisable human body had some particular soil like that of the cemetery saint michel at bordeaux
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5328.mp3	preserved it thus for so many ages it might be so but this dried corpse with its parchment like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame the limbs still preserving their shape sound teeth abundant hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5329.mp3	and finger and toe nails of frightful length this desiccated mummy startled us by appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago i stood mute before this apparition of remote antiquity my uncle usually so garrulous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5330.mp3	was struck dumb likewise we raised the body we stood it up against a rock it seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits we sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame after some moments silence the professor was himself again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5331.mp3	otto liedenbrock yielding to his nature forgot all the circumstances of our eventful journey forgot where we were standing forgot the vaulted cavern which contained us no doubt he was in mind back again in his johannaeum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5332.mp3	holding forth to his pupils for he assumed his learned air and addressing himself to an imaginary audience he proceeded thus gentlemen i have the honour to introduce to you a man of the quaternary or post tertiary system
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5333.mp3	eminent geologists have denied his existence others no less eminent have affirmed it the saint thomases of palaeontology if they were here might now touch him with their fingers and would be obliged to acknowledge their error
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5334.mp3	i am quite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of this kind i know what capital enterprising individuals like barnum have made out of fossil men i have heard the tale of the kneepan of ajax
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5335.mp3	the pretended body of orestes claimed to have been found by the spartans and of the body of asterius ten cubits long
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5336.mp3	i have read the reports of the skeleton of trapani found in the fourteenth century and which was at the time identified as that of polyphemus and the history of the giant unearthed in the sixteenth century near palermo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5337.mp3	you know as well as i do gentlemen the analysis made at lucerne in fifteen seventy seven of those huge bones which the celebrated doctor felix plater affirmed to be those of a giant nineteen feet high
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5338.mp3	in the eighteenth century i would have stood up for scheuchzer's pre adamite man against peter campet i have perused a writing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5339.mp3	here my uncle's unfortunate infirmity met him that of being unable in public to pronounce hard words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5340.mp3	he could get no further
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5341.mp3	it was not to be done the unlucky word would not come out at the johannaeum there would have been a laugh gigantosteologie at last the professor burst out between two words which i shall not record here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5342.mp3	have recognised in these bones nothing more remarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the post tertiary period but in the presence of this specimen to doubt would be to insult science there stands the body you may see it touch it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5343.mp3	it is not a mere skeleton it is an entire body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5344.mp3	i was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion if i could only wash it in a solution of sulphuric acid pursued my uncle i should be able to clear it from all the earthy particles and the shells which are incrusted about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5345.mp3	but i do not possess that valuable solvent yet such as it is the body shall tell us its own wonderful story here the professor laid hold of the fossil skeleton and handled it with the skill of a dexterous showman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5346.mp3	you see he said that it is not six feet long and that we are still separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5347.mp3	it is evidently caucasian it is the white race our own the skull of this fossil is a regular oval or rather ovoid it exhibits no prominent cheekbones no projecting jaws
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5348.mp3	it presents no appearance of that prognathism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5349.mp3	it is nearly ninety degrees but i will go further in my deductions and i will affirm that this specimen of the human family is of the japhetic race which has since spread from the indies to the atlantic don't smile gentlemen nobody was smiling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5350.mp3	but the learned professor was frequently disturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities yes he pursued with animation this is a fossil man the contemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5351.mp3	how those strata on which he lay slipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe i confess i cannot answer that question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5352.mp3	considerable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth the long continued cooling of the globe produced chasms fissures clefts and faults into which very probably portions of the upper earth may have fallen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5353.mp3	but there is the man surrounded by his own works by hatchets by flint arrow heads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5354.mp3	this fossil body was not the only one in this immense catacomb we came upon other bodies at every step amongst this mortal dust and my uncle might select the most curious of these specimens to demolish the incredulity of sceptics
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5355.mp3	in fact it was a wonderful spectacle that of these generations of men and animals commingled in a common cemetery then one very serious question arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5356.mp3	had all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust of the earth down to the shores of the liedenbrock sea when they were dead and turning to dust or had they lived and grown and died here in this subterranean world under a false sky

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5364.mp3	are doubtless offshoots from ancient folk lore songs and have descended to us through many centuries the connection of mother goose with the rhymes which bear her name is difficult to determine and in fact three countries claim her for their own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5365.mp3	france england and america about the year sixteen fifty there appeared in circulation in london a small book named rhymes of the nursery or lulla byes for children

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5377.mp3	but the rest of the story is unsupported by any evidence whatever in fact all that mister eliot knew of it was the statement of the late edward a crowninshield of boston that he had seen fleet's edition in the library of the american antiquarian society
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5378.mp3	repeated researches at worcester having failed to bring to light this supposed copy and no record of it appearing on any catalogue there we may dismiss the entire story with the supposition that mister eliot misunderstood the remarks made to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5379.mp3	indeed as mister william h whitmore points out in his clever monograph upon mother goose albany eighteen eighty nine it is very doubtful whether in seventeen nineteen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5380.mp3	boston children at that date says mister whitmore were fed upon gospel food and it seems extremely improbable that an edition could have been sold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5381.mp3	is of about the same date as boston's there lived in a town in sussex about the year seventeen o four an old woman named martha gooch she was a capital nurse and in great demand to care for newly born babies therefore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5382.mp3	through long years of service as nurse she came to be called mother gooch this good woman had one peculiarity she was accustomed to croon queer rhymes and jingles over the cradles of her charges and these rhymes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5383.mp3	seemed so senseless and silly to the people who overheard them that they began to call her mother goose in derision the term being derived from queen goosefoot the mother of charlemagne the old nurse paid no attention to her critics
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5384.mp3	but continued to sing her rhymes as before for however much grown people might laugh at her the children seemed to enjoy them very much and not one of them was too peevish to be quieted and soothed by her verses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5385.mp3	at one time mistress gooch was nursing a child of mister ronald barclay a physician residing in the town and he noticed the rhymes she sang and became interested in them in time he wrote them all down and made a book of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5386.mp3	which it is said was printed by john worthington and son in the strand london in seventeen twelve under the name of ye melodious rhymes of mother goose but even this story of martha gooch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5387.mp3	is based upon very meager and unsatisfactory evidence the earliest english edition of mother goose's melodies that is absolutely authentic was issued by john newbury of london about the year seventeen sixty and the first authentic american edition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5388.mp3	in seventeen eighty five none of the earlier editions however contained all the rhymes so well known at the present day since every decade has added its quota to the mass of jingles attributed to mother goose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5389.mp3	some of the earlier verses have become entirely obsolete and it is well they have for many were crude and silly and others were coarse it is simply a result of the greater refinement of modern civilization
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5390.mp3	that they have been relegated to oblivion while the real gems of the collection will doubtless live and grow in popular favor for many ages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5391.mp3	it does not matter in the least whether she was in reality a myth or a living eliza goose martha gooch or the mere oye of perrault the songs that cluster around her name are what we love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5392.mp3	and each individual verse appeals more to the childish mind than does mother goose herself many of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves telling their story tersely but completely there are others which are but bare suggestions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5393.mp3	leaving the imagination to weave in the details of the story perhaps therein may lie part of their charm but however that may be i have thought the children might like the stories told at greater length that they may dwell the longer upon their favorite heroes and heroines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5394.mp3	for that reason i have written this book in making the stories i have followed mainly the suggestions of the rhymes and my hope is that the little ones will like them and not find that they interfere with the fanciful creations of their own imaginations

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5396.mp3	and one of these flocks used to be cared for by a poor woman who supported herself and her little girl by this means they lived in a small cottage nestled at the foot of one of the hills and each morning the mother took her crook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5397.mp3	and started out with her sheep that they might feed upon the tender juicy grasses with which the hills abounded the little girl usually accompanied her mother and sat by her side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5398.mp3	upon the grassy mounds and watched her care for the ewes and lambs so that in time she herself grew to be a very proficient shepherdess so when the mother became too old and feeble to leave her cottage little bo peep as she was called
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5399.mp3	decided that she was fully able to manage the flocks herself she was a little mite of a child with flowing nut brown locks and big gray eyes that charmed all who gazed into their innocent depths she wore a light gray frock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5400.mp3	fastened about the waist with a pretty pink sash and there were white ruffles around her neck and pink ribbons in her hair all the shepherds and shepherdesses upon the hills both young and old soon came to know little bo peep very well indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5401.mp3	and there were many willing hands to aid her if which was not often she needed their assistance bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon a mound and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5402.mp3	laying aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons devoted her time to sewing and mending stockings for her aged mother one day while thus occupied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5403.mp3	good morning little bo peep and looking up the girl saw a woman standing near her and leaning upon a short stick she was bent nearly double by weight of many years her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as coals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5404.mp3	deep wrinkles seamed her face and hands while her nose and chin were so pointed that they nearly met she was not pleasant to look upon but bo peep had learned to be polite to the aged so she answered sweetly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5405.mp3	good morning mother can i do anything for you no dearie returned the woman in a cracked voice but i will sit by your side and rest for a time the girl made room on the mound beside her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5406.mp3	and the stranger sat down and watched in silence the busy fingers sew up the seams of the new frock she was making by and by the woman asked why do you come out here to sew because i am a shepherdess replied the girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5407.mp3	but where is your crook on the grass beside me and where are your sheep bo peep looked up and could not see them they must have strayed over the top of the hill she said and i will go and seek them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5408.mp3	do not be in a hurry croaked the old woman they will return presently without your troubling to find them do you think so asked bo peep of course do not the sheep know you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5409.mp3	oh yes they know me every one and do not you know the sheep i can call every one by name said bo peep confidently for though i am so young a shepherdess i am fond of my sheep and know all about them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5410.mp3	the old woman chuckled softly as if the answer amused her and replied no one knows all about anything my dear but i know all about my sheep protested little bo peep do you indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5411.mp3	then you are wiser that most people and if you know all about them you also know they will come home of their own accord and i have no doubt they will all be wagging their tails behind them as usual
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5412.mp3	oh said little bo peep in surprise do they wag their tails i never noticed that indeed exclaimed the old woman then you are not very observing for one who knows all about sheep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5413.mp3	perhaps you have never noticed their tails at all no answered bo peep thoughtfully i do n't know that i ever have the woman laughed so hard at this reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5414.mp3	that she began to cough and this made the girl remember that her flock had strayed away i really must go and find my sheep she said rising to her feet and then i shall be sure to notice their tails and see if they wag them sit still my child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5415.mp3	said the old woman i am going over the hill top myself and i will send the sheep back to you so she got upon her feet and began climbing the hill and the girl heard her saying as she walked away little bo peep has lost her sheep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5416.mp3	and does n't know where to find em but leave em alone and they ll come home all wagging their tails behind em little bo peep sat still and watched the old woman toil slowly up the hill side and disappear over the top by and by she thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5417.mp3	very soon i shall see the sheep coming back but time passed away and still the errant flock failed to make its appearance soon the head of the little shepherdess began to nod
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5418.mp3	little bo peep fell fast asleep and dreamt she heard them bleating but when she awoke she found it a joke for still they were a fleeting the girl now became quite anxious and wondered why the old woman had not driven her flock over the hill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5419.mp3	but as it was now time for luncheon she opened her little basket and ate of the bread and cheese and cookies she had brought with her after she had finished her meal and taken a drink of cool water from a spring near by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5420.mp3	she decided she would not wait any longer so up she took her little crook determined for to find them and began climbing the hill when she got to the top there was never a sight of sheep about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5421.mp3	only a green valley and another hill beyond now really alarmed for the safety of her charge bo peep hurried into the valley and up the farther hill side panting and tired she reached the summit and pausing breathlessly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5422.mp3	gazed below her quietly feeding upon the rich grass was her truant flock looking as peaceful and innocent as if it had never strayed away from its gentle shepherdess bo peep uttered a cry of joy and hurried toward them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5423.mp3	but when she came near she stopped in amazement and held up her little hands with a pretty expression of dismay she had found them indeed but it made her heart bleed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5424.mp3	nothing was left to each sheep but a wee little stump where a tail should be and little bo peep was so heart broken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5425.mp3	but after awhile the tiny maid realized that all her tears would not bring back the tails to her lambkins so she plucked up courage and dried her eyes and arose from the ground just as the old woman hobbled up to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5426.mp3	so you have found your sheep dearie she said in her cracked voice yes replied little bo peep with difficulty repressing a sob but look mother they ve all left their tails behind them why so they have exclaimed the old woman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5427.mp3	and then she began to laugh as if something pleased her what do you suppose has become of their tails asked the girl oh some one has probably cut them off they make nice tippets in winter time you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5428.mp3	and then she patted the child upon her head and walked away down the valley bo peep was much grieved over the loss that had befallen her dear sheep and so driving them before her she wandered around to see if by any chance she could find the lost tails
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5429.mp3	but soon the sun began to sink over the hill tops and she knew she must take her sheep home before night overtook them she did not tell her mother of her misfortune for she feared the old shepherdess would scold her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5430.mp3	and bo peep had fully decided to seek for the tails and find them before she related the story of their loss to anyone each day for many days after that little bo peep wandered about the hills seeking the tails of her sheep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5431.mp3	and those who met her wondered what had happened to make the sweet little maid so anxious but there is an end to all troubles no matter how severe they may seem to be and it happened one day as bo peep did stray unto a meadow hard by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5432.mp3	the little shepherdess was overjoyed at this discovery and reaching up her crook she knocked the row of pretty white tails off the tree and gathered them up in her frock but how to fasten them onto her sheep again was the question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5433.mp3	and after pondering the matter for a time she became discouraged and thinking she was no better off than before the tails were found she began to weep and to bewail her misfortune but amidst her tears she bethought herself of her needle and thread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5434.mp3	why she exclaimed smiling again i can sew them on of course then she heaved a sigh and wiped her eye and ran o'er hill and dale oh and tried what she could as a shepherdess should to tack to each sheep its tail oh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5435.mp3	but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sew on the tail and ran away from her and the others did the same so that finally she was utterly discouraged she was beginning to cry again when the same old woman she had before met
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5436.mp3	came hobbling to her side and asked what are you doing with my cat tails your cat tails replied bo peep in surprise what do you mean why these tails are all cut from white pussycats and i put them on the tree to dry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5437.mp3	what are you doing with them i thought they belonged to my sheep answered bo peep sorrowfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5438.mp3	i must hunt until i find those that belong to my sheep my dear said the old woman i have been deceiving you you said you knew all about your sheep and i wanted to teach you a lesson for however wise we may be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5439.mp3	no one in this world knows all about anything sheep do not have long tails there is only a little stump to answer for a tail neither do rabbits have tails nor bears nor many other animals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5440.mp3	and if you had been observing you would have known all this when i said the sheep would be wagging their tails behind them and then you would not have passed all those days in searching for what is not to be found
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5441.mp3	so now little one run away home and try to be more thoughtful in the future your sheep will never miss the tails
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5442.mp3	and now little bo peep no more did weep my tale of tails ends here

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5451.mp3	each well provided with a garden scattered about prettily on either side of the road it was sufficiently commodious to hold pupils in addition to a growing family and was in those times considered to be above the average of parsonages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5452.mp3	no cornice marked the junction of wall and ceiling while the beams which supported the upper floors projected into the rooms below in all their naked simplicity covered only by a coat of paint or whitewash
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5453.mp3	and about forty five years ago it was pulled down for the purpose of erecting a new house in a far better situation on the opposite side of the valley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5454.mp3	on the south side the ground rose gently and was occupied by one of those old fashioned gardens in which vegetables and flowers are combined flanked and protected on the east by one of the thatched mud walls common in that country and overshadowed by fine elms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5455.mp3	along the upper or southern side of this garden ran a terrace of the finest turf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5456.mp3	but the chief beauty of steventon consisted in its hedgerows a hedgerow in that country does not mean a thin formal line of quickset but an irregular border of copse wood and timber often wide enough to contain within it a winding footpath or a rough cart track
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5457.mp3	and now and then the unwelcome adder two such hedgerows radiated as it were from the parsonage garden one a continuation of the turf terrace proceeded westward forming the southern boundary of the home meadows

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5485.mp3	and it may be reasonably supposed that some of the incidents and feelings which are so vividly painted in the mansfield park theatricals are due to her recollections of these entertainments some time before they left steventon one great affliction came upon the family

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5487.mp3	this little domestic tragedy caused great and lasting grief to the principal sufferer and could not but cast a gloom over the whole party the sympathy of jane was probably from her age and her peculiar attachment to her sister

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5490.mp3	and we should almost add a female writing from recollection capable this conjecture however probable was wide of the mark the picture was drawn from the intuitive perceptions of genius not from personal experience

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5493.mp3	there is however one passage of romance in her history with which i am imperfectly acquainted and to which i am unable to assign name or date or place though i have it on sufficient authority
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5494.mp3	many years after her death some circumstances induced her sister cassandra to break through her habitual reticence and to speak of it

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5508.mp3	potatoes were used but not so abundantly as now and there was an idea that they were to be eaten only with roast meat they were novelties to a tenant's wife who was entertained at steventon parsonage certainly less than a hundred years ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5509.mp3	and when missus austen advised her to plant them in her own garden she replied no no they are very well for you gentry but they must be terribly costly to rear but a still greater difference would be found in the furniture of the rooms

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5511.mp3	it was to be found only where there was a decided taste for music not so common then as now or in such great houses as would probably contain a billiard table there would often be but one sofa in the house and that a stiff angular

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5516.mp3	a small writing desk with a smaller work box or netting case was all that each young lady contributed to occupy the table for the large family work basket though often produced in the parlour lived in the closet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5517.mp3	there must have been more dancing throughout the country in those days than there is now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5518.mp3	as if it were a natural production with less fastidiousness as to the quality of music lights and floor many country towns had a monthly ball throughout the winter in some of which the same apartment served for dancing and tea room

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5521.mp3	and made of importance many things connected with the ball rooms of those days have now passed into oblivion the barbarous law which confined the lady to one partner throughout the evening must indeed have been abolished before jane went to balls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5522.mp3	it must be observed however that this custom was in one respect advantageous to the gentleman inasmuch as it rendered his duties more practicable he was bound to call upon his partner the next morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5523.mp3	to gallop all the country over the last night's partner to behold and humbly hope she caught no cold but the stately minuet still reigned supreme and every regular ball commenced with it it was a slow and solemn movement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5524.mp3	expressive of grace and dignity rather than of merriment it abounded in formal bows and courtesies with measured paces forwards backwards and sideways and many complicated gyrations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5525.mp3	it was executed by one lady and gentleman amidst the admiration or the criticism of surrounding spectators in its earlier and most palmy days as when sir charles and lady grandison delighted the company by dancing it at their own wedding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5526.mp3	the gentleman wore a dress sword and the lady was armed with a fan of nearly equal dimensions addison observes that women are armed with fans as men with swords and sometimes do more execution with them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5527.mp3	the graceful carriage of each weapon was considered a test of high breeding the clownish man was in danger of being tripped up by his sword getting between his legs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5528.mp3	and i have been told that those ladies who intended to dance minuets used to distinguish themselves from others by wearing a particular kind of lappet on their head dress i have heard also of another curious proof of the respect in which this dance was held
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5529.mp3	gloves immaculately clean were considered requisite for its due performance while gloves a little soiled were thought good enough for a country dance and accordingly some prudent ladies provided themselves with two pairs for their several purposes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5530.mp3	the minuet expired with the last century but long after it had ceased to be danced publicly it was taught to boys and girls in order to give them a graceful carriage hornpipes cotillons and reels were occasionally danced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5531.mp3	but the chief occupation of the evening was the interminable country dance in which all could join this dance presented a great show of enjoyment but it was not without its peculiar troubles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5532.mp3	the ladies and gentlemen were ranged apart from each other in opposite rows so that the facilities for flirtation or interesting intercourse were not so great as might have been desired by both parties much heart burning and discontent sometimes arose as to who should stand above whom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5533.mp3	and especially as to who was entitled to the high privilege of calling and leading off the first dance and no little indignation was felt at the lower end of the room when any of the leading couples retired prematurely from their duties and did not condescend to dance up and down the whole set
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5534.mp3	we may rejoice that these causes of irritation no longer exist and that if such feelings as jealousy rivalry and discontent ever touch celestial bosoms in the modern ball room they must arise from different and more recondite sources
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5535.mp3	i am tempted to add a little about the difference of personal habits it may be asserted as a general truth that less was left to the charge and discretion of servants and more was done or superintended by the masters and mistresses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5536.mp3	with regard to the mistresses it is i believe generally understood that at the time to which i refer a hundred years ago they took a personal part in the higher branches of cookery as well as in the concoction of home made wines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5537.mp3	and distilling of herbs for domestic medicines which are nearly allied to the same art ladies did not disdain to spin the thread of which the household linen was woven some ladies liked to wash with their own hands their choice china after breakfast or tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5538.mp3	as that they took an interest in such occupations and it must be borne in mind how many sources of interest enjoyed by this generation were then closed or very scantily opened to ladies a very small minority of them cared much for literature or science
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5539.mp3	but i doubt whether the rising generation are equally aware how much gentlemen also did for themselves in those times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5540.mp3	than they are now master's eye makes the horse fat and if you would be well served serve yourself some gentlemen took pleasure in being their own gardeners performing all the scientific and some of the manual work themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5541.mp3	well dressed young men of my acquaintance who had their coat from a london tailor would always brush their evening suit themselves rather than entrust it to the carelessness of a rough servant and to the risks of dirt and grease in the kitchen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5542.mp3	for in those days servants halls were not common in the houses of the clergy and the smaller country gentry it was quite natural that catherine morland should have contrasted the magnificence of the offices at northanger abbey with the few shapeless pantries in her father's parsonage

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5544.mp3	it was thought meritorious on the evening of a hunting day to turn out after dinner lanthorn in hand and visit the stable to ascertain that the horse had been well cared for this was of the more importance because previous to the introduction of clipping about the year eighteen twenty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5545.mp3	it was a difficult and tedious work to make a long coated hunter dry and comfortable and was often very imperfectly done of course such things were not practised by those who had gamekeepers and stud grooms and plenty of well trained servants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5546.mp3	but they were practised by many who were unequivocally gentlemen and whose grandsons occupying the same position in life may perhaps be astonished at being told that such things were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5547.mp3	of course they cannot be universally applicable such details varied in various circles and were changed very gradually
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5548.mp3	but it is probable that their way of life differed a little from ours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5549.mp3	it may be that useful articles which would not now be produced in drawing rooms were hemmed and marked and darned in the old fashioned parlour but all this concerned only the outer life there was as much cultivation and refinement of mind as now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5550.mp3	the early hour at which hounds then met may account for this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5551.mp3	for they hunted at an early age in a scrambling sort of way upon any pony or donkey that they could procure or in default of such luxuries on foot i have been told that sir francis austen when seven years old

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5632.mp3	but she offered no extenuation or defence and with a kind of shameless calmness shocking indeed to witness in one so young as good as told me that my remonstrance was unavailing and my pastoral advice quite thrown away upon her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5633.mp3	nay that my very presence was displeasing while i spoke such things and i withdrew at length too plainly seeing that nothing could be done and sadly grieved to find her case so hopeless

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5636.mp3	the next minute saw me hurrying with rapid strides in the direction of wildfell hall to what intent or purpose i could scarcely tell but i must be moving somewhere and no other goal would do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5637.mp3	i must see her too and speak to her that was certain but what to say or how to act i had no definite idea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5638.mp3	when all were gone i learnt that the vile slander had indeed been circulated throughout the company in the very presence of the victim rose however vowed she did not and would not believe it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5639.mp3	and my mother made the same declaration though not i fear with the same amount of real unwavering incredulity it seemed to dwell continually on her mind and she kept irritating me from time to time by such expressions as
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5640.mp3	the foundation is in the wickedness and falsehood of the world said i and in the fact that mister lawrence has been seen to go that way once or twice of an evening and the village gossips say he goes to pay his addresses to the strange lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5641.mp3	and the scandal mongers have greedily seized the rumour to make it the basis of their own infernal structure well but gilbert there must be something in her manner to countenance such reports did you see anything in her manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5642.mp3	no certainly but then you know i always said there was something strange about her i believe it was on that very evening that i ventured on another invasion of wildfell hall from the time of our party
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5643.mp3	which was upwards of a week ago i had been making daily efforts to meet its mistress in her walks and always disappointed she must have managed it so on purpose had nightly kept revolving in my mind some pretext for another call
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5644.mp3	at length i concluded that the separation could be endured no longer by this time you will see i was pretty far gone and taking from the book case an old volume that i thought she might be interested in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5645.mp3	though from its unsightly and somewhat dilapidated condition i had not yet ventured to offer it for perusal i hastened away but not without sundry misgivings as to how she would receive me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5646.mp3	or how i could summon courage to present myself with so slight an excuse but perhaps i might see her in the field or the garden and then there would be no great difficulty it was the formal knocking at the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5647.mp3	with the prospect of being gravely ushered in by rachel to the presence of a surprised uncordial mistress that so greatly disturbed me my wish however was not gratified
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5648.mp3	missus graham herself was not to be seen but there was arthur playing with his frolicsome little dog in the garden i looked over the gate and called him to me he wanted me to come in but i told him i could not without his mother's leave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5649.mp3	he ran to perform my bidding and quickly returned with his mother how lovely she looked with her dark ringlets streaming in the light summer breeze her fair cheek slightly flushed and her countenance radiant with smiles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5650.mp3	there is no mediator like a merry simple hearted child ever ready to cement divided hearts to span the unfriendly gulf of custom to melt the ice of cold reserve and overthrow the separating walls of dread formality and pride
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5651.mp3	well mister markham what is it said the young mother accosting me with a pleasant smile i want you to look at this book and if you please to take it and peruse it at your leisure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5652.mp3	i make no apology for calling you out on such a lovely evening though it be for a matter of no greater importance tell him to come in mamma said arthur would you like to come in asked the lady yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5653.mp3	i should like to see your improvements in the garden and how your sister's roots have prospered in my charge added she as she opened the gate and we sauntered through the garden and talked of the flowers the trees and the book
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5654.mp3	and then of other things the evening was kind and genial and so was my companion by degrees i waxed more warm and tender than perhaps i had ever been before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5655.mp3	but still i said nothing tangible and she attempted no repulse until in passing a moss rose tree that i had brought her some weeks since in my sister's name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5656.mp3	and i saw a flash of ecstatic brilliance in her eye a glow of glad excitement on her face i thought my hour of victory was come but instantly a painful recollection seemed to flash upon her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5657.mp3	a cloud of anguish darkened her brow a marble paleness blanched her cheek and lip there seemed a moment of inward conflict and with a sudden effort she withdrew her hand and retreated a step or two back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5658.mp3	now mister markham said she with a kind of desperate calmness i must tell you plainly that i cannot do with this i like your company because i am alone here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5659.mp3	and let me alone hereafter in fact we must be strangers for the future i will then be your friend or brother or anything you wish if you will only let me continue to see you but tell me why i cannot be anything more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5660.mp3	there was a perplexed and thoughtful pause is it in consequence of some rash vow it is something of the kind she answered some day i may tell you but at present you had better leave me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5661.mp3	and never gilbert put me to the painful necessity of repeating what i have just now said to you she earnestly added giving me her hand in serious kindness how sweet how musical my own name sounded in her mouth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5662.mp3	i will not i replied but you pardon this offence on condition that you never repeat it and may i come to see you now and then perhaps occasionally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5663.mp3	provided you never abuse the privilege i make no empty promises but you shall see the moment you do our intimacy is at an end that's all and will you always call me gilbert
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5664.mp3	but as i went the tramp of horses hoofs fell on my ear and broke the stillness of the dewy evening and looking towards the lane i saw a solitary equestrian coming up inclining to dusk as it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5665.mp3	and seemed inclined to turn back but on second thought apparently judged it better to continue his course as before he accosted me with a slight bow and edging close to the wall endeavoured to pass on but i was not so minded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5666.mp3	you and your pony be what makes you so coarse and brutal markham i'm quite ashamed of you you answer my questions before you leave this spot i will know what you mean by this perfidious duplicity

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5668.mp3	but i quickly re captured the pony scarce less astonished than its master at such uncivil usage really mister markham this is too much said the latter can i not go to see my tenant on matters of business without being assaulted in this manner by

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5740.mp3	my encounter with the martians had taken place in a short time we gained the foot of the mountains and after traversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley at the far extremity of which was a low table land upon which i beheld
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5741.mp3	an enormous city toward this we galloped entering it by what appeared to be a ruined roadway leading out from the city but only to the edge of the table land where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5742.mp3	upon closer observation i saw as we passed them that the buildings were deserted and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not having been tenanted for years possibly for ages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5743.mp3	toward the center of the city was a large plaza and upon this and in the buildings immediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred creatures of the same breed as my captors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5744.mp3	for such i now considered them despite the suave manner in which i had been trapped with the exception of their ornaments all were naked the women varied in appearance but little from the men except that their tusks were much larger in proportion to their height

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5750.mp3	the average life expectancy of a martian after the age of maturity is about three hundred years but would be nearer the one thousand mark were it not for the various means leading to violent death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5751.mp3	owing to the waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary to counteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill in therapeutics and surgery produced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5752.mp3	and so human life has come to be considered but lightly on mars as is evidenced by their dangerous sports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5753.mp3	without a weapon of destruction as we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious to pluck me from my seat behind my guard a word from the leader of the party
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5754.mp3	stilled their clamor and we proceeded at a trot across the plaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has rested upon the building was low but covered an enormous area
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5755.mp3	it was constructed of gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which sparkled and scintillated in the sunlight the main entrance was some hundred feet in width and projected from the building proper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5756.mp3	to form a huge canopy above the entrance hall there was no stairway but a gentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an enormous chamber encircled by galleries on the floor of this chamber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5757.mp3	which was dotted with highly carved wooden desks and chairs were assembled about forty or fifty male martians around the steps of a rostrum on the platform proper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5758.mp3	gay colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings ingeniously set with precious stones from his shoulders depended a short cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk what struck me as most remarkable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5759.mp3	about this assemblage and the hall in which they were congregated was the fact that the creatures were entirely out of proportion to the desks chairs and other furnishings these being of a size adapted to human beings such as i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5760.mp3	whereas the great bulks of the martians
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5761.mp3	nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs evidently then there were other denizens on mars than the wild and grotesque creatures into whose hands i had fallen but the evidences of extreme antiquity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5762.mp3	and at a sign from the leader i had been lowered to the ground again locking his arm in mine we had proceeded into the audience chamber there were few formalities observed in approaching the martian chieftain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5763.mp3	my captor merely strode up to the rostrum the others making way for him as he advanced the chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of my escort who in turn halted and repeated the name of the ruler followed by his title
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5764.mp3	at the time this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing to me but later i came to know that this was the customary greeting between green martians had the men been strangers and therefore unable to exchange names
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5765.mp3	had their missions been peaceful otherwise they would have exchanged shots or have fought out their introduction with some other of their various weapons my captor whose name was tars tarkas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5766.mp3	and when he had concluded the chieftain addressed me at some length i replied in our good old english tongue merely to convince him that neither of us could understand the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5767.mp3	but i noticed that when i smiled slightly on concluding he did likewise this fact and the similar occurrence during my first talk with tars tarkas convinced me that we had at least something in common the ability to smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5768.mp3	therefore to laugh denoting a sense of humor but i was to learn that the martian smile is merely perfunctory and that the martian laugh is a thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror the ideas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5769.mp3	of incitants to merriment the death agonies of a fellow being are to these strange creatures provocative of the wildest hilarity while their chief form of commonest amusement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5770.mp3	is to inflict death on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways the assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely feeling my muscles and the texture of my skin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5771.mp3	the principal chieftain then evidently signified a desire to see me perform and motioning me to follow he started with tars tarkas for the open plaza now i had made no attempt to walk since my first signal failure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5772.mp3	and so now i went skipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like some monstrous grasshopper after bruising myself severely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5773.mp3	and i did the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances of brutality boorishness and lack of consideration for a stranger's rights i swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like a felled ox
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5774.mp3	as he sunk to the floor i wheeled around with my back toward the nearest desk expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeance of his fellows but determined to give them as good a battle as the unequal odds would permit before i gave up my life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5775.mp3	my fears were groundless however as the other martians at first struck dumb with wonderment finally broke into wild peals of laughter and applause i did not recognize the applause as such but later
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5776.mp3	when i had become acquainted with their customs i learned that i had won what they seldom accord a manifestation of approbation the fellow whom i had struck lay where he had fallen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5777.mp3	but i was not long in being enlightened they first repeated the word sak a number of times and then tars tarkas made several jumps repeating the same word before each leap then turning to me he said sak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5778.mp3	i saw what they were after and gathering myself together i sakked with such marvelous success that i cleared a good hundred and fifty feet nor did i this time lose my equilibrium but landed squarely upon my feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5779.mp3	without falling i then returned by easy jumps of twenty five or thirty feet to the little group of warriors my exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser martians and they immediately broke into demands for a repetition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5780.mp3	which the chieftain then ordered me to make but i was both hungry and thirsty and determined on the spot that my only method of salvation was to demand the consideration from these creatures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5781.mp3	which they evidently would not voluntarily accord i therefore ignored the repeated commands to sak and each time they were made i motioned to my mouth and rubbed my stomach
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5782.mp3	tars tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words and the former calling to a young female among the throng gave her some instructions and motioned me to accompany her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5783.mp3	i grasped her proffered arm and together we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side my fair companion was about eight feet tall having just arrived at maturity but not yet to her full height
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5784.mp3	she was of a light olive green color with a smooth glossy hide her name as i afterward learned was sola and she belonged to the retinue of tars tarkas she conducted me to a spacious chamber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5785.mp3	in one of the buildings fronting on the plaza and which from the litter of silks and furs upon the floor i took to be the sleeping quarters of several of the natives the room was well lighted by a number of large windows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5786.mp3	and was beautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5787.mp3	made a peculiar hissing sound as though signaling to someone in an adjoining room in response to her call i obtained my first sight of a new martian wonder it waddled in on its ten short legs and squatted down before the girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5788.mp3	like an obedient puppy the thing was about the size of a shetland pony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5789.mp3	chapter three my advent on mars i opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape i knew that i was on mars not once did i question either my sanity or my wakefulness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5790.mp3	i was not asleep no need for pinching here my inner consciousness told me as plainly that i was upon mars as your conscious mind tells you that you are upon earth you do not question the fact
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5791.mp3	neither did i i found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish mosslike vegetation which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles i seemed to be lying in a deep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5792.mp3	the irregularities of low hills it was midday the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was rather intense upon my naked body yet no greater
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5793.mp3	than would have been true under similar conditions on an arizona desert here and there were slight outcroppings of quartz bearing rock which glistened in the sunlight and a little to my left perhaps a hundred yards appeared a low walled enclosure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5794.mp3	about four feet in height no water and no other vegetation than the moss was in evidence and as i was somewhat thirsty i determined to do a little exploring springing to my feet i received my first martian surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5795.mp3	for the effort which on earth would have brought me standing upright carried me into the martian air to the height of about three yards i alighted softly upon the ground however without appreciable shock or jar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5796.mp3	now commenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in the extreme i found that i must learn to walk all over again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5797.mp3	as the muscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon earth played strange antics with me upon mars instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5798.mp3	my attempts to walk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a couple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5799.mp3	my muscles perfectly attuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on earth played the mischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the lesser gravitation and lower air pressure on mars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5800.mp3	i was determined however to explore the low structure which was the only evidence of habitation in sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5801.mp3	it had ever been given me to see the roof of the enclosure was of solid glass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5802.mp3	and beneath this were several hundred large eggs perfectly round and snowy white the eggs were nearly uniform in size being about two and one half feet in diameter five or six had already hatched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5803.mp3	and the grotesque caricatures which sat blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity they seemed mostly head with little scrawny bodies long necks and six legs or
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5804.mp3	as i afterward learned two legs and two arms with an intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms or legs their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a trifle above the center
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5805.mp3	without the necessity of turning the head the ears which were slightly above the eyes and closer together were small cup shaped antennae protruding not more than an inch on these young specimens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5806.mp3	their noses were but longitudinal slits in the center of their faces midway between their mouths and ears there was no hair on their bodies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5807.mp3	these latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and terrible countenance as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5808.mp3	the whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory but of the snowiest and most gleaming of china against the dark background of their olive skins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5809.mp3	making these weapons present a singularly formidable appearance most of these details i noted later for i was given but little time to speculate on the wonders of my new discovery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5810.mp3	on such a little thing my life hung that i often marvel that i escaped so easily had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from its fastenings beside his saddle in such a way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5811.mp3	as to strike against the butt of his great metal shod spear i should have snuffed out without ever knowing that death was near me but the little sound caused me to turn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5812.mp3	and there upon me not ten feet from my breast was the point of that huge spear a spear forty feet long tipped with gleaming metal and held low at the side of a mounted replica
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5813.mp3	of the little devils i had been watching but how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrific incarnation of hate of vengeance and of death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5814.mp3	was fully fifteen feet in height
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5815.mp3	he sat his mount as we sit a horse grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs while the hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the side of his mount
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5816.mp3	his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help preserve his balance the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins of any description for guidance and his mount
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5817.mp3	how can earthly words describe it it towered ten feet at the shoulder had four legs on either side a broad flat tail larger at the tip than at the root and which it held
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5818.mp3	straight out behind while running a gaping mouth which split its head from its snout to its long massive neck like its master it was entirely devoid of hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5819.mp3	its belly was white and its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid yellow at the feet the feet themselves were heavily padded and nailless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5820.mp3	which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their approach and in common with a multiplicity of legs is a characteristic feature of the fauna of mars the highest type of man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5821.mp3	and one other animal the only mammal existing on mars alone have well formed nails and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in existence there behind this first charging demon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5822.mp3	trailed nineteen others similar in all respects but as i learned later bearing individual characteristics peculiar to themselves precisely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5823.mp3	as no two of us are identical although we are all cast in a similar mold this picture or rather materialized nightmare which i have described at length
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5824.mp3	as i turned to meet it unarmed and naked as i was the first law of nature manifested itself in the only possible solution of my immediate problem and that was to get out of the vicinity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5825.mp3	of the point of the charging spear consequently i gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap to reach the top of the martian incubator for such i had determined it must be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5826.mp3	my effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it seemed to surprise the martian warriors for it carried me fully thirty feet into the air and landed me a hundred feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5827.mp3	from my pursuers and on the opposite side of the enclosure i alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap and turning saw my enemies lined up along the further wall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5828.mp3	some were surveying me with expressions which i afterward discovered marked extreme astonishment and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that i had not molested their young
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5829.mp3	they were conversing together in low tones and gesticulating and pointing toward me their discovery that i had not harmed the little martians and that i was unarmed must have caused them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5830.mp3	to look upon me with less ferocity but as i was to learn later the thing which weighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling while the martians are immense their bones are very large
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5831.mp3	and i doubt that were one of them suddenly to be transported to earth he could lift his own weight from the ground in fact i am convinced that he could not do so my feat then was as marvelous upon mars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5832.mp3	as it would have been upon earth and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me as a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their fellows the respite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5833.mp3	with which we are familiar the weight of these rifles is comparatively little and with the small caliber explosive radium projectiles which they use and the great length of the barrel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5834.mp3	they are deadly in the extreme
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5835.mp3	which would be unthinkable on earth the theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles but the best they can do in actual service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5836.mp3	when equipped with their wireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles this is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the martian firearm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5837.mp3	and some telepathic force must have warned me against an attempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of these death dealing machines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5838.mp3	when they had covered perhaps two hundred yards they halted and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the warrior by the enclosure he was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5839.mp3	and came around the end of the incubator toward me entirely unarmed and as naked as i except for the ornaments strapped upon his head limbs and breast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5840.mp3	when he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormous metal armlet and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand addressed me in a clear resonant voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5841.mp3	he then stopped as though waiting for my reply pricking up his antennae like ears and cocking his strange looking eyes still further toward me as the silence became painful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5842.mp3	i concluded to hazard a little conversation on my own part as i had guessed that he was making overtures of peace the throwing down of his weapons and the withdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5843.mp3	so why not then on mars placing my hand over my heart i bowed low to the martian and explained to him that while i did not understand his language
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5844.mp3	his actions spoke for the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear to my heart of course i might have been a babbling brook for all the intelligence my speech carried to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5845.mp3	but he understood the action with which i immediately followed my words stretching my hand toward him i advanced and took the armlet from his open palm clasping it about my arm above the elbow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5846.mp3	smiled at him and stood waiting his wide mouth spread into an answering smile and locking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked back toward his mount
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5847.mp3	at the same time he motioned his followers to advance they started toward us on a wild run
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5848.mp3	evidently he feared that were i to be really frightened again i might jump entirely out of the landscape he exchanged a few words with his men motioned to me that i would ride behind one of them and then mounted his own animal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5849.mp3	the fellow designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him on the glossy back of his mount
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5850.mp3	and it is true that a person can deliberately hypnotize himself when he wishes to till he has become accustomed to it and is expert in it so to speak it does away at a stroke with the claims of all professional hypnotists and magnetic healers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5851.mp3	that they have any peculiar power in themselves which they exert over their fellows one of these professionals gives an account in his book of what he calls the wonderful lock method he says that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5852.mp3	though he is locked up in a separate room he can make the psychic power work through the walls all that he does is to put his subjects in the way of hypnotizing themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5853.mp3	he shows his inconsistency when he states that under certain circumstances the hypnotizer is in danger of becoming hypnotized himself in this he makes no claim that the subject is using any psychic power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5854.mp3	but of course if the hypnotizer looks steadily into the eyes of his subject and the subject looks into his eyes the steady gaze on a bright object will produce hypnotism in one quite as readily as in the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5855.mp3	hypnotism is an established scientific fact but the claim that the hypnotizer has any mysterious psychic power is the invariable mark of the charlatan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5856.mp3	probably no scientific phenomenon was ever so grossly prostituted to base ends as that of hypnotism later we shall see some of the outrageous forms this charlatanism assumes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5857.mp3	and how it extends to the professional subjects as well as to the professional operators till those subjects even impose upon scientific men who ought to be proof against such deception
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5858.mp3	moreover the possibility of self hypnotization carefully concealed and called by another name opens another great field of humbug and charlatanism of which the advertising columns of the newspapers are constantly filled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5859.mp3	namely that of the clairvoyant and medium we may conceive how such a profession might become perfectly legitimate and highly useful but at present it seems as if any person who went into it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5860.mp3	however honest he might be at the start soon began to deceive himself as well as others until he lost his power entirely to distinguish between fact and imagination before discussing the matter further
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5861.mp3	let us quote doctor cocke's experiment in hypnotizing himself it will be remembered that a professional hypnotizer or magnetizer had hypnotized him by telling him to fix his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5862.mp3	i was intensely cold my heart seemed to stand still i had ringing in my ears my hair seemed to rise upon my scalp i persisted in the effort and the previously mentioned noise in my ears grew louder and louder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5863.mp3	the roar became deafening it crackled like a mighty fire i was fearfully conscious of myself having read vivid accounts of dreams visions et cetera it occurred to me that i would experience them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5864.mp3	i felt in a vague way that there were beings all about me but could not hear their voices i felt as though every muscle in my body was fixed and rigid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5865.mp3	the roar in my ears grew louder still and i heard above the roar reports which sounded like artillery and musketry then above the din of the noise a musical chord i seemed to be absorbed in this chord i knew nothing else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5866.mp3	secondly i wished to be hypnotized these together with a vivid imagination and strained attention brought on the states which occurred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5867.mp3	his descriptions of dreams bear a wonderful likeness to de quincey's dreams such as those described in the english mail coach de profundis and the confessions of an english opium eater
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5868.mp3	all of which were presumably due to opium the causes which doctor cocke thinks produced the hypnotic condition in his case namely belief desire to be hypnotized and strained attention united with a vivid imagination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5869.mp3	are causes which are often found in conjunction and produce effects which we may reasonably explain on the theory of self hypnotization
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5870.mp3	for instance the effects of an exciting religious revival are very like those produced by mesmer's operations in paris the subjects become hysterical and are ready to believe anything or do anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5871.mp3	by prolonging the operation a whole community becomes more or less hypnotized in all such cases however unusual excitement is commonly followed by unusual lethargy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5872.mp3	in fact it is a sort of intoxication the same phenomena are probably accountable for many of the strange records of history the wonderful cures at lourdes of which we have read in zola's novel of that name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5873.mp3	are no doubt the effect of hypnotization by the priests some of the strange movements of whole communities during the crusades are to be explained either on the theory of hypnotization or of contagion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5874.mp3	and possibly these two things will turn out to be much the same in fact on no other ground can we explain the so called children's crusade in which over thirty thousand children from germany from all classes of the community
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5875.mp3	tried to cross the alps in winter and in their struggles were all lost or sold into slavery without even reaching the holy land again hypnotism is accountable for many of the poet's dreams
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5876.mp3	gazing steadily at a bed of bright coals or a stream of running water will invariably throw a sensitive subject into a hypnotic sleep that will last sometimes for several hours doctor cocke says
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5877.mp3	that he has experimented in this direction with patients of his says he they have the ability to resist the state or to bring it at will many of them describe beautiful scenes from nature or some mighty cathedral
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5878.mp3	with its lofty dome or the faces of imaginary beings beautiful or demoniacal according to the will and temper of the subject perhaps the most wonderful example of self hypnotism which we have in history
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5879.mp3	is that of the mystic swedenborg who saw such strange things in his visions and at last came to believe in them as real the same explanation may be given of the manifestations of oriental prophets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5880.mp3	for in the orient hypnotism is much easier and more systematically developed than with us of the west the performances of the dervishes and also of the fakirs who wound themselves and perform many wonderful feats
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5881.mp3	their impersonations are ridiculous in the extreme one man i remember believed himself to be controlled by the spirit of charles sumner being uneducated he used the most wretched english
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5882.mp3	and his language was utterly devoid of sense while on the other hand a very intelligent lady who believed herself to be controlled by the spirit of charlotte cushman personated the part very well doctor cooke says of himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5883.mp3	i can hypnotize myself to such an extent that i will become wholly unconscious of events taking place around me and a long interval of time say from one half to two hours will be a complete blank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5884.mp3	how the subject feels under hypnotization doctor cooper's experience effect of music doctor alfred marthieu's experiments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5885.mp3	the sensations produced during a state of hypnosis are very interesting as may be supposed they differ greatly in different persons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5886.mp3	one of the most interesting accounts ever given is that of doctor james r cocke a hypnotist himself who submitted to being operated upon by a professional magnetizer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5887.mp3	he was at that time a firm believer in the theory of personal magnetism a delusion from which he afterward escaped on the occasion which he describes the operator commanded him to close his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5888.mp3	but he did open them at once again he told him to close the eyes and at the same time he gently stroked his head and face and eyelids with his hand doctor cocke fancied he felt a tingling sensation in his forehead and eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5889.mp3	which he supposed came from the hand of the operator afterward he came to believe that this sensation was purely imaginary on his part then he says a sensation akin to fear came over me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5890.mp3	the operator said you are going to sleep you are getting sleepy you cannot open your eyes i was conscious that my heart was beating rapidly and i felt a sensation of terror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5891.mp3	he then made passes over my head down over my hands and body but did not touch me he then said to me you cannot open your eyes the motor apparatus of my lids would not seemingly respond to my will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5892.mp3	yet i was conscious that while one part of my mind wanted to open my eyes another part did not want to so i was in a paradoxical state i believed that i could open my eyes and yet could not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5893.mp3	the feeling of not wishing to open my eyes was not based upon any desire to please the operator i had no personal interest in him in any way but be it understood i firmly believed in his power to control me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5894.mp3	then he stroked the arm and said it was growing numb he said you have no feeling in it have you doctor cocke goes on i said no and i knew that i said no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5895.mp3	the operator went on pricking the arm with a pin and though doctor cocke felt the pain he said he did not feel it and at the same time the sensation of terror increased i was not conscious of my body at all he says further on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5896.mp3	but i was painfully conscious of the two contradictory elements within me i knew that my body existed but could not prove it to myself i knew that the statements made by the operator were in a measure untrue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5897.mp3	i obeyed them voluntarily and involuntarily this is the last remembrance that i have of that hypnotic experience after this however the operator caused the doctor to do a number of things which he learned of from his friends after the performance was over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5898.mp3	it seemed to me that the hypnotist commanded me to awake as soon as i dropped my arm and yet ten minutes of unconsciousness had passed on a subsequent occasion doctor cocke who was blind was put into a deep hypnotic sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5899.mp3	by fixing his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand this time he experienced a still greater degree of terror and incidentally learned that he could hypnotize himself the matter of self hypnotism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5900.mp3	we shall consider in another chapter in this connection we find great interest in an article in the medical news july twenty eighth eighteen ninety four
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5901.mp3	in which he describes the effects of music upon hypnotic subjects while in vienna he took occasion to observe closely the enthusiastic musical devotees as they sat in the audience at the performance of one of wagner's operas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5902.mp3	he believed they were in a condition of self induced hypnotism in which their subjective faculties were so exalted as to supersede their objective perceptions music was no longer to them a succession of pleasing sounds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5903.mp3	but the embodiment of a drama in which they became so wrapped up that they forgot all about the mechanical and external features of the music and lived completely in a fairy world of dream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5904.mp3	this observation suggested to him an interesting series of experiments his first subject was easily hypnotized and of an emotional nature wagner's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5905.mp3	was played from the piano score the pulse of the subject became more rapid and at first of higher tension increasing from a normal rate of sixty beats a minute to one hundred twenty then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5906.mp3	as the music progressed the tension diminished the respiration increased from eighteen to thirty per minute great excitement in the subject was evident his whole body was thrown into motion his legs were drawn up his arms tossed into the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5907.mp3	the state of mind brought up before him in the most realistic and vivid manner possible the picture of the ride of tam o'shanter which he had seen years before the picture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5908.mp3	soon became real to him and he found himself taking part in a wild chase not as witch devil or tam even but in some way his consciousness was spread through every part of the scene being of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5909.mp3	and yet playing the part of spectator as is often the case in dreams doctor warthin tried the same experiment again this time on a young man who was not so emotional and was hypnotized with much more difficulty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5910.mp3	this subject did not pass into such a deep state of hypnotism but the result was practically the same the pulse rate rose from seventy to one hundred twenty the sensation remembered was that of riding furiously through the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5911.mp3	the experiment was repeated on other subjects in all cases with the same result
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5912.mp3	to him it always expressed the pictured wild ride of the daughters of wotan the subject taking part in the ride it was noticeable in each case that the same music played to them in the waking state produced no special impression
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5913.mp3	at first it seemed to produce the opposite effect for the pulse was lowered later it rose to a rate double the normal and the tension was diminished the impression described by the subject afterward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5914.mp3	and the subject seemed to contemplate a landscape of lofty grandeur a different sort of music was played
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5915.mp3	appears to summon sigmund to valhalla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5916.mp3	it became slow and irregular and very small the respiration decreased almost to gasping the face grew pale and a cold perspiration broke out readers who are especially interested in this subject
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5917.mp3	will find descriptions of many other interesting experiments in the same article doctor cocke describes a peculiar trick he played upon the sight of a subject says he i once hypnotized a man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5918.mp3	and call the letters as i directed stimulation was in this case impossible as i made him read fifteen or twenty pages he calling the letters as suggested each time they occurred the extraordinary heightening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5919.mp3	and clairvoyance if the powers of the mind are so enormously increased all that is required of a very sensitive and easily hypnotized person is to hypnotize him or herself when he will be able to read thoughts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5920.mp3	courting a broomstick the side show let us now describe some of the manifestations of hypnotism to see just how it operates and how it exhibits itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5921.mp3	the following is a description of a public performance given by doctor herbert l flint a very successful public operator it is in the language of an eye witness a new york lawyer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5922.mp3	in response to a call for volunteers twenty young and middle aged men came upon the stage they evidently belonged to the great middle class the entertainment commenced by doctor flint passing around the group
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5923.mp3	who were seated on the stage in a semicircle facing the audience and stroking each one's head and forehead repeating the phrases close your eyes think of nothing but sleep you are very tired you are drowsy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5924.mp3	you feel very sleepy as he did this several of the volunteers closed their eyes at once and one fell asleep immediately one or two remained awake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5925.mp3	while a few were wide awake and smiling at the rest these latter were dismissed as unlikely subjects when the stage had been cleared of all those who were not responsive the doctor passed around and snapping his finger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5926.mp3	at each individual awoke him one of the subjects when questioned afterward as to what sensation he experienced at the snapping of the fingers replied that it seemed to him as if something inside of his head responded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5927.mp3	and with this sensation he regained self consciousness this is to be doubted as a rule subjects in this stage of hypnotism do not feel any sensation that they can remember
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5928.mp3	that you can't pull them apart they are fast you cannot pull them apart try you can't the whole class made frantic efforts to unclasp their hands but were unable to do so the doctor's explanation of this is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5929.mp3	that what they were really doing was to force their hands closer together thus obeying the counter suggestion that they thought they were trying to unclasp their hands was evident from their endeavors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5930.mp3	one young fellow aged about eighteen said that he was addicted to the cigarette habit the suggestion was made to him that he would not be able to smoke a cigarette for twenty four hours after the entertainment he was asked to smoke as was his usual habit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5931.mp3	he was then away from any one who could influence him he replied that the very idea was repugnant however he was induced to take a cigarette in his mouth but it made him ill and he flung it away with every expression of disgust
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5932.mp3	this is an instance of what is called post hypnotic suggestion doctor cocke tells of suggesting to a drinker whom he was trying to cure of the habit that for the next three days anything he took would make him vomit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5933.mp3	they immediately began and twirled them faster and faster in spite of their efforts to stop one of the subjects said he thought of nothing but the strange action of his hands and sometimes it puzzled him to know why they whirled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5934.mp3	at this point doctor flint's daughter took charge of the class she pointed her finger at one of them and the subject began to look steadily before him at which the rest of the class were highly amused
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5935.mp3	presently the subject's head leaned forward the pupils of his eyes dilated and assumed a peculiar glassy stare he arose with a steady gliding gait
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5936.mp3	then he stopped miss flint led him to the front of the stage and left him standing in profound slumber he stood there stooping eyes set and vacant fast asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5937.mp3	in the meantime the act had caused great laughter among the rest of the class one young fellow in particular laughed so uproariously that tears coursed down his cheeks and he took out his handkerchief to wipe his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5938.mp3	just as he was returning it to his pocket the lady suddenly pointed a finger at him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5939.mp3	but the moment the gesture was made his countenance fell his mirth stopped while that of his companions redoubled and the change was so obvious that the audience shared in the laughter but the subject neither saw nor heard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5940.mp3	his eyes assumed the same expression that had been noticed in his companion's he too arose in the same attitude as if his head were pulling the body along and following the finger in the same way as his predecessor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5941.mp3	another was given a broomstick and told to hunt game in the woods before him another was given a large rag doll and told that it was an infant and that he must look among the audience and discover the father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5942.mp3	he was informed that he could tell who the father was by the similarity and the color of the eyes these suggestions were made in a loud tone miss flint being no nearer one subject than another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5943.mp3	the bare suggestion was given as now think that you are a newsboy and are selling papers or now think that you are hunting and are going into the woods to shoot birds so the party was started
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5944.mp3	at the same time into the audience the one who was impersonating a newsboy went about crying his edition in a loud voice while the hunter crawled along stealthily and carefully

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5946.mp3	and taking him into the center of the stage showed him a small riding whip he looked at it indifferently enough he was told it was a hot bar of iron but he shook his head still incredulous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5947.mp3	the suggestion was repeated and as the glazed look came into his eyes the incredulous look died out every member of the class was following the suggestion made to the subject in hand all of them had the same expression in their eyes the doctor said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5948.mp3	that his daughter was hypnotizing the whole class through this one individual as she spoke she lightly touched the subject with the end of the whip the moment the subject felt the whip he jumped and shrieked as if it really were a hot iron
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5949.mp3	she touched each one of the class in succession and every one manifested the utmost pain and fear one subject sat down on the floor and cried in dire distress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5950.mp3	had the suggestion been continued it would undoubtedly have raised a blister one of the amusing experiments tried at a later time was that of a tall young man diffident pale and modest being given a broom carefully wrapped in a sheet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5951.mp3	and told that it was his sweetheart he accepted the situation and sat down by the broom he was a little sheepish at first but eventually he grew bolder and smiled upon her such a smile as malvolio casts upon olivia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5952.mp3	the manner in which little by little he ventured upon a familiar footing was exceedingly funny but when in a moment of confident response to his wooing he clasped her round the waist and imprinted a chaste kiss upon the brushy part of the broom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5953.mp3	disguised by the sheet the house resounded with roars of laughter the subject however was deaf to all of the noise he was absorbed in his courtship and he continued to hug the broom and exhibit in his features
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5954.mp3	all the world loves a lover as the saying is and all the world loves to laugh at him one of the subjects was told that the head of a man in the audience was on fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5955.mp3	he looked for a moment and then dashed down the platform into the audience and seizing the man's head vigorously rubbed it as this did not extinguish the flames he took off his coat and put the fire out in doing this he set his coat on fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5956.mp3	then he calmly resumed his garment and walked back to the stage the side show closed the evening's entertainment a young man was told to think of himself as managing a side show at a circus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5957.mp3	when his mind had absorbed this idea he was ordered to open his exhibition he at once mounted a table and in the voice of the traditional side show fakir began to dilate upon the fat woman and the snakes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5959.mp3	he pointed to a suppositious canvas picture he chaffed the boys he flattered the vanity of the young fellows with their girls telling them that they could not afford for the small sum of ten cents to miss this great show
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5960.mp3	when the little fleet of spanish vessels including the one which had been captured by bartholemy portuguez and his men were on their way to campeachy they met with very stormy weather so that they were separated and the ship which contained bartholemy and his companions arrived first at the port for which they were bound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5961.mp3	the captain who had bartholemy and the others in charge did not know what an important capture he had made he supposed that these pirates were ordinary buccaneers and it appears that it was his intention to keep them as his own private prisoners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5962.mp3	for as they were all very able bodied men they would be extremely useful on a ship but when his vessel was safely moored and it became known in the town that he had a company of pirates on board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5963.mp3	and who had heard of his various exploits he therefore went to the captain of the vessel and informed him that he had on board one of the very worst pirates in the whole world whose wicked deeds were well known in various parts of the west indies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5964.mp3	and who ought immediately to be delivered up to the civil authorities this proposal however met with no favor from the spanish captain who had found bartholemy a very quiet man and could see that he was a very strong one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5965.mp3	and he did not at all desire to give up such a valuable addition to his crew but the merchant grew very angry for he knew that bartholemy had inflicted great injury on spanish commerce and as the captain would not listen to him he went to the governor of the town and reported the case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5966.mp3	when this dignitary heard the story he immediately sent a party of officers to the ship and commanded the captain to deliver the pirate leader into their charge the other men were left where they were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5967.mp3	but he did not lose heart and immediately set to work to free himself from his irons which were probably very clumsy affairs at last caring little how much he scratched and tore his skin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5968.mp3	he succeeded in getting rid of his fetters and could move about as freely as a tiger in a cage to get out of this cage was bartholemy's first object it would be comparatively easy because in the course of time some one would come into the hold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5969.mp3	and the athletic buccaneer thought that he could easily get the better of whoever might open the hatch but the next act in this truly melodramatic performance would be a great deal more difficult for in order to escape from the ship it would be absolutely necessary for bartholemy to swim to shore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5970.mp3	and he did not know how to swim which seems a strange failing in a hardy sailor with so many other nautical accomplishments in the rough hold where he was shut up our pirate peering about anxious and earnest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5971.mp3	he was satisfied that this unwieldy contrivance would support him in the water among other things he had found in his rummagings about the hold was an old knife and with this in his hand he now sat waiting for a good opportunity to attack his sentinel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5972.mp3	this came soon after nightfall a man descended with a lantern to see that the prisoner was still secure let us hope that it was not the soldier who had kindly informed him of his fate and as soon as he was fairly in the hold bartholemy sprang upon him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5973.mp3	there was a fierce struggle but the pirate was quick and powerful and the sentinel was soon dead then carrying his two jars bartholemy climbed swiftly and noiselessly up the short ladder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5974.mp3	for a moment he sank below the surface but the two air tight jars quickly rose and bore him up with them there was a bustle on board the ship there was some random firing of muskets in the direction of the splashing which the watch had heard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5975.mp3	but none of the balls struck the pirate or his jars and he soon floated out of sight and hearing kicking out with his legs and paddling as well as he could with one hand while he held on to the jars with the other he at last managed to reach the land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5976.mp3	and ran as fast as he could into the dark woods beyond the town bartholemy was now greatly in fear that when his escape was discovered he would be tracked by bloodhounds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5977.mp3	which was what he wished to do if the hounds should get upon his trail he was a lost man the desperate pirate therefore determined to give the bloodhounds no chance to follow him and for three days he remained in a marshy forest in the dark recesses of which he could hide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5978.mp3	and where the water which covered the ground prevented the dogs from following his scent he had nothing to eat except a few roots of water plants but he was accustomed to privation and these kept him alive often he heard the hounds baying on the dry land adjoining the marsh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5979.mp3	and sometimes he saw at night distant torches which he was sure were carried by men who were hunting for him but at last the pursuit seemed to be given up and hearing no more dogs and seeing no more flickering lights bartholemy left the marsh and set out on his long journey down the coast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5980.mp3	which was forty leagues away but where he had reason to suppose he would find some friends when he came out from among the trees he mounted a small hill and looked back upon the town the public square was lighted and there in the middle of it he saw the gallows which had been erected for his execution
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5981.mp3	and this sight doubtless animated him very much during the first part of his journey the terrible trials and hardships which bartholemy experienced during his tramp along the coast were such as could have been endured only by one of the strongest and toughest of men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5982.mp3	but after a diet of roots shellfish must have been a very agreeable change and they gave him all the strength and vigor he needed very often he found streams and inlets which he was obliged to ford
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5983.mp3	when he had made for himself what seemed to be a free passage he would dash in and hurry across at other times great forests stretched down to the very coast and through these he was obliged to make his way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5984.mp3	although he could hear the roars and screams of wild beasts all about him any one who is afraid to go down into a dark cellar to get some apples from a barrel at the foot of the stairs can have no idea of the sort of mind possessed by bartholemy portuguez
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5985.mp3	the animals might howl around him and glare at him with their shining eyes and the alligators might lash the water into foam with their great tails
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5986.mp3	this was a wide river flowing through the inland country into the sea he made his way up the shore of this river for a considerable distance but it grew but little narrower and he could see no chance of getting across he could not swim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5987.mp3	and he had no wine jars now with which to buoy himself up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5988.mp3	but a man in his situation would not be likely to give up readily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5989.mp3	now a piece of good fortune happened to him although to an ordinary traveller it might have been considered a matter of no importance whatever on the edge of the shore where it had floated down from some region higher up the river
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5990.mp3	bartholemy perceived an old board in which there were some long and heavy rusty nails greatly encouraged by this discovery the indefatigable traveller set about a work which resembled that of the old woman who wanted a needle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5991.mp3	and who began to rub a crow bar on a stone in order to reduce it to the proper size bartholemy carefully knocked all the nails out of the board and then finding a large flat stone he rubbed down one of them until he had formed it into the shape of a rude knife blade
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5992.mp3	which he made as sharp as he could then with these tools he undertook the construction of a raft working away like a beaver and using the sharpened nails instead of his teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5993.mp3	he cut down a number of small trees and when he had enough of these slender trunks he bound them together with reeds and osiers which he found on the river bank so after infinite labor and trial he constructed a raft which would bear him on the surface of the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5994.mp3	gathering up his legs so as to keep out of reach of the alligators and with a long pole pushed himself off from shore sometimes paddling and sometimes pushing his pole against the bottom he at last got across the river and took up his journey upon dry land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5995.mp3	even if he could not walk no athlete of the present day no matter if he should be a most accomplished circus man could reasonably expect to perform the feat which this bold pirate successfully accomplished for five or six leagues he went through that mangrove forest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5996.mp3	never once setting his foot upon the ground by which is meant mud water and roots but swinging himself by his hands and arms from branch to branch as if he had been a great ape only resting occasionally drawing himself upon a stout limb where he might sit for a while and get his breath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5997.mp3	a sputtering of musketry was always to be heard later the cannon had entered the dispute in the fog filled air their voices made a thudding sound the reverberations were continual

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/5999.mp3	he could see the low line of trenches but for a short distance a few idle flags were perched on the dirt hills
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6000.mp3	always the noise of skirmishers came from the woods on the front and left and the din on the right had grown to frightful proportions the guns were roaring without an instant's pause for breath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6001.mp3	it seemed that the cannon had come from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous wrangle it became impossible to make a sentence heard the youth wished to launch a joke a quotation from newspapers he desired to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6002.mp3	all quiet on the rappahannock but the guns refused to permit even a comment upon their uproar he never successfully concluded the sentence but at last the guns stopped and among the men in the rifle pits rumors again flew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6003.mp3	like birds but they were now for the most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily near to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope the men's faces grew doleful from the interpreting of omens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6004.mp3	stories of disaster were borne into their minds with many proofs this din of musketry on the right growing like a released genie of sound expressed and emphasized the army's plight the men were disheartened and began to mutter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6005.mp3	and it could always be seen that they were bewildered by the alleged news and could not fully comprehend a defeat before the gray mists had been totally obliterated by the sun rays the regiment was marching in a spread column that was retiring carefully through the woods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6006.mp3	the disordered hurrying lines of the enemy could sometimes be seen down through the groves and little fields they were yelling shrill and exultant at this sight the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly enraged he exploded in loud sentences
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6007.mp3	observed a man his friend recently aroused was still very drowsy he looked behind him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement then he sighed oh well i s'pose we got licked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6008.mp3	he remarked sadly the youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely condemn other men he made an attempt to restrain himself but the words upon his tongue were too bitter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6009.mp3	he presently began a long and intricate denunciation of the commander of the forces mebbe it wa'n't all his fault not all together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6010.mp3	it's our luck t git licked often said his friend in a weary tone he was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has been caned and kicked well don't we fight like the devil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6011.mp3	don't we do all that men can demanded the youth loudly he was secretly dumfounded at this sentiment when it came from his lips for a moment his face lost its valor and he looked guiltily about him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6012.mp3	but no one questioned his right to deal in such words and presently he recovered his air of courage he went on to repeat a statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that morning the brigadier said he never saw a new reg'ment fight the way we fought yestirday didn't he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6013.mp3	in his reply the friend's voice was stern a course not he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6014.mp3	but still still we don't have no luck well then if we fight like the devil an don't ever whip it must be the general's fault said the youth grandly and decisively
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6015.mp3	and i don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and fighting yet always losing through some derned old lunkhead of a general
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6016.mp3	the speech pierced the youth inwardly he was reduced to an abject pulp by these chance words his legs quaked privately he cast a frightened glance at the sarcastic man why no he hastened to say in a conciliating voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6017.mp3	i don't think i fought the whole battle yesterday but the other seemed innocent of any deeper meaning apparently he had no information it was merely his habit oh he replied in the same tone of calm derision
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6018.mp3	the youth nevertheless felt a threat his mind shrank from going near to the danger and thereafter he was silent the significance of the sarcastic man's words took from him all loud moods that would make him appear prominent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6019.mp3	he became suddenly a modest person there was low toned talk among the troops the officers were impatient and snappy their countenances clouded with the tales of misfortune
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6020.mp3	the troops sifting through the forest were sullen in the youth's company once a man's laugh rang out a dozen soldiers turned their faces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6021.mp3	the noise of firing dogged their footsteps sometimes it seemed to be driven a little way but it always returned again with increased insolence the men muttered and cursed throwing black looks in its direction

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6027.mp3	nobody seems to know where we go or why we go we just get fired around from pillar to post and get licked here and get licked there and nobody knows what it's done for it makes a man feel like a damn kitten in a bag
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6028.mp3	now i'd like to know what the eternal thunders we was marched into these woods for anyhow unless it was to give the rebs a regular pot shot at us we came in here and got our legs all tangled up in these cussed briers

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6031.mp3	at this time there was an interposition by the savage minded lieutenant who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his men you boys shut right up

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6034.mp3	the day had grown more white until the sun shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest a sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward that part of the line where lay the youth's regiment the front shifted a trifle to meet it squarely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6035.mp3	there was a wait in this part of the field there passed slowly the intense moments that precede the tempest a single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment in an instant it was joined by many others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6036.mp3	there was a mighty song of clashes and crashes that went sweeping through the woods the guns in the rear aroused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burr like at them suddenly involved themselves in a hideous altercation with another band of guns
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6037.mp3	the battle roar settled to a rolling thunder which was a single long explosion in the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6040.mp3	that he had come back a comparative pauper surprised no one for this was a common thing to happen to a pirate but the wonder was that he got back at all he had no money but by the exercise of his crafty abilities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6041.mp3	he managed to get possession of a ship which he manned with a crew of about a score of impecunious dare devils who were very anxious to do something to mend their fortunes having now become very fond of land fighting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6042.mp3	he did not go out in search of ships but directed his vessel to a little village called de los cayos on the coast of cuba for here he thought was a chance for a good and easy stroke of business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6043.mp3	so that large ships could not approach very near and thus the villagers were kept busy carrying goods and supplies in small boats backwards and forwards from the town to the vessels at anchor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6044.mp3	here was a nice little prize that could not get away from him and l'olonnois had plenty of time to make his preparations to seize it as he could not sail a ship directly up to the town
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6045.mp3	he cruised about the coast at some distance from de los cayos endeavoring to procure two small boats in which to approach the town but although his preparations were made as quietly as possible the presence of his vessel was discovered by some fishermen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6046.mp3	informing the governor of the island that the cruel pirate l'olonnois was in a ship a short distance from their village which he undoubtedly intended to attack when the governor heard this astonishing tale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6047.mp3	it was almost impossible for him to believe it the good news of the death of l'olonnois had come from campeachy to havana and the people of the latter town also rejoiced greatly to be now told that this scourge of the west indies was alive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6048.mp3	and was about to fall upon a peaceful little village on the island over which he ruled filled the governor with rage as well as amazement and he ordered a well armed ship with a large crew of fighting men to sail immediately for de los cayos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6049.mp3	by the time the war vessel had arrived at de los cayos l'olonnois had made his preparation to attack the place he had procured two large canoes and in these he had intended to row up to the town and land with his men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6050.mp3	but now there was a change in the state of affairs and he was obliged to alter his plans the ordinary person in command of two small boats who should suddenly discover that a village which he supposed almost defenceless was protected by a large man of war
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6051.mp3	with cannon and a well armed crew would have altered his plans so completely that he would have left that part of the coast of cuba with all possible expedition but the pirates of that day seemed to pay very little attention to the element of odds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6052.mp3	if they met an enemy who was weak they would fall upon him and if they met with one who was a good deal stronger than themselves they would fall upon him all the same when the time came to fight they fought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6053.mp3	but no intention of giving up his project entered his mind as the spanish vessel was in his way he would attack her and get her out of his way if the thing could be done in this new state of affairs he was obliged to use stratagem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6054.mp3	and he also needed a larger force than he had with him and he therefore captured some men who were fishing along the coast and put them into his canoes to help work the oars then by night he proceeded slowly in the direction of the spanish vessel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6055.mp3	the man of war was anchored not very far from the town and when about two o'clock in the morning the watch on deck saw some canoes approaching they supposed them to be boats from shore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6056.mp3	for as has been said such vessels were continually plying about those shallow waters the canoes were hailed and after having given an account of themselves they were asked if they knew anything about the pirate ship upon the coast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6057.mp3	but their way was a very different one from any which could have been expected by the captain of the ship they rowed off into the darkness instead of going toward the town and waited until nearly daybreak then they boldly made for the man of war
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6058.mp3	one canoe attacking her on one side and the other on the other before the spanish could comprehend what had happened there were more than twenty pirates upon their decks the dreaded l'olonnois at their head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6059.mp3	and they fought each scoundrel of them like three men and the savage fight ended by every spanish sailor or officer who was not killed or wounded being forced to stay below decks where the hatches were securely fastened down upon them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6060.mp3	l'olonnois now stood a proud victor on the deck of his prize and being a man of principle he determined to live up to the distinguished reputation which he had acquired in that part of the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6061.mp3	baring his muscular and hairy right arm he clutched the handle of his sharp and heavy cutlass and ordered the prisoners to be brought up from below one at a time and conducted to the place where he stood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6062.mp3	he wished to give spain a lesson which would make her understand that he was not to be interfered with in the execution of his enterprises and he determined to allow himself the pleasure of personally teaching this lesson
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6063.mp3	this man who was not a soldier was desperately frightened and begged piteously for his life l'olonnois finding that the man was willing to tell everything he knew questioned him about the sending of this vessel from havana
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6064.mp3	and when the poor fellow had finished by telling that he had come there not of his own accord but simply for the purpose of obeying his master to hang all the pirates except their leader that great buccaneer laughed and finding he could get nothing more from the negro
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6065.mp3	cut off his head likewise and his body was tumbled into the sea after those of his companions now there was not a spaniard left on board the great ship except one man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6066.mp3	who had been preserved from the fate of the others because l'olonnois had some correspondence to attend to and he needed a messenger to carry a letter the pirate captain went into the cabin where he found writing materials ready to his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6067.mp3	and there he composed a letter to the governor of havana a part of which read as follows i shall never henceforward give quarter unto any spaniard whatsoever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6068.mp3	when this message was received by the dignified official who filled the post of governor of cuba he stormed and fairly foamed at the mouth to be utterly foiled and discomfited by this resurrected pirate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6069.mp3	and to be afterwards addressed in terms of such unheard of insolence and abuse was more than he could bear and in the presence of many of his officials and attendants he swore a terrible oath that after that hour he would never again give quarter to any buccaneer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6070.mp3	but when the inhabitants of havana and the surrounding villages heard of this terrible resolution of their governor they were very much disturbed they lived in constant danger of attack especially those who were engaged in fishing or maritime pursuits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6071.mp3	and they feared that when it became known that no buccaneer was to receive quarter the spanish colonists would be treated in the same way no matter where they might be found and taken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6072.mp3	consequently it was represented to the governor that his plan of vengeance would work most disastrously for the spanish settlers for the buccaneers could do far more damage to them than he could possibly do to these dreadful brethren of the coast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6073.mp3	and that unless he wished to bring upon them troubles greater than those of famine or pestilence they begged that he would retract his oath when the high dignitary had cooled down a little he saw that there was a good deal of sense in what the representative of the people had said to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6074.mp3	and he also discovered much to his surprise that there were very few provisions on board for when the vessel was sent from havana it was supposed she would make but a very short cruise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6075.mp3	there were a few stars dying out in the dark west the atmosphere was clear and when the sun rose i knew he would turn the sable pall overhead into blueness the hull lay very deep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6076.mp3	i had at one time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6077.mp3	and a deep of rolling sapphire i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the bulwark rail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6078.mp3	yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was visible now to its most trifling detail the foremast was gone smooth off at the deck it lay over the starboard bow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6079.mp3	one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat it was thus we carried those boats the little one lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6080.mp3	had floated the jolly boat out of the long boat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the brig struck the berg the masts fell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6081.mp3	and there lay the long boat crushed into staves this signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness though my spirits sank again at the sight of my poor drowned shipmates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6082.mp3	and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a handspike prised her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6083.mp3	when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hatful of water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6084.mp3	but i met with an oar that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past my next business was to victual her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6085.mp3	i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to be come at i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6086.mp3	eight or ten biscuits some candles a tinder box several lemons a little bag of flower and thirteen bottles of beer these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6087.mp3	the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to make haste she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming in broad liquid blue brows to her stem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6088.mp3	it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her and if the swell fell over her bows and filled the decks down she would go i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest and was about to fetch this money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6089.mp3	when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hull gave me a fright and watching my chance i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her adrift the sun was an hour above the horizon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6090.mp3	heaving very slowly though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold and eastwards the shoulders of the swell catching the glorious reflection of the sun hurled the splendour along
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6091.mp3	till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle upon the eastern sea line lay a range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6092.mp3	shot with pearly lustre floated overhead very high it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed but the air being dry its shrewdness was endurable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6093.mp3	with us had it dawned yesterday instead of to day my companions would have been alive and yonder sinking ruined fabric a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6094.mp3	i threw the oar over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig not so much because i desired to see the last of her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6095.mp3	into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky whilst the hull floated she was something to hold on to so to say something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6096.mp3	and her main deck blew up with a loud clap or blast of noise i could follow the line of her bulwarks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6097.mp3	and which she dragged down with her on a sudden when the last fragment of mast had disappeared and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea up rose a body with a sort of leap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6098.mp3	it was the sailor that had lain drowned on the starboard side of the forward deck being frozen stiff he rose in the posture in which he had expired that is with his arms extended
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6099.mp3	so that when he jumped to the surface he came with his hands lifted up to heaven and thus he stayed a minute sustained by the eddies which also revolved him the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6100.mp3	and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason i rose from the seat on to which i had sunk and loosed the sail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6101.mp3	and hauling the sheet aft put the oar over the stern and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course the draught of air was extremely weak and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6102.mp3	the boat was about fifteen feet long
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6103.mp3	ere i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view at the start i had a mind to steer north west and blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6104.mp3	where perchance i might meet a whaler or a southseaman from new holland but my heart sank at the prospect of the leagues of water which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6105.mp3	i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up and that though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6106.mp3	than by sailing into the great desolation of the north west the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6107.mp3	i am persuaded my heart must have broken and that i should have died of grief faintly as the wind blew it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6108.mp3	and then all was bare bald swelling sea and empearled sky darkening in lagoons of azure down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapour lying like the coast of a continent on the larboard horizon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6109.mp3	but one living thing there was besides myself a grey breasted albatross of a princely width of pinion i had not observed it till the hull went down and then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6110.mp3	lifting my eyes with involuntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6111.mp3	it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fowls of its dominions and poised on tremorless wings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6112.mp3	was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6113.mp3	the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me its eyes had the sparkling blood red gleam of rubies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6114.mp3	it was as silent as a phantom and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable so far from finding any comfort of companionship in the creature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6115.mp3	it uttered a strange salt cry the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon a rope flapped its wings and after a turn or two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6116.mp3	i lay for a long while insensible and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvellous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6117.mp3	i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to me my hair was stiff with ice there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6118.mp3	my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armour so inflexibly hard were they frozen yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk and that life flowed warm in my veins
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6119.mp3	it was intensely dark the binnacle lamp was extinguished and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest colour upon the hatchway one thing i quickly noticed that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6120.mp3	there was less spite in its wash less fury in its blow the multitudinous roaring of the heaving blackness had sobered into a hard and sullen growling a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6121.mp3	the brig pitched and rolled heavily much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her nevertheless i could not persuade myself that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6122.mp3	it was wonderful however that she should still be afloat no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6123.mp3	finding that i had the use of my voice i holloaed as loudly as i could but no human note responded three or four times i shouted giving some of the people their names but in vain father of mercy i thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6124.mp3	what has come to pass is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard certainly five men at least were living before we fouled the ice and again i cried out is there any one alive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6125.mp3	my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold in utter darkness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6126.mp3	it was dreadful i say to be thus placed and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest most desolate space of sea in the world into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6127.mp3	but no feature of my lamentable situation so affrighted me so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness oh for one companion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6128.mp3	even one only to make me an echo for mine own speech nay god himself the merciful father of all even he seemed not the blackness lay like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6129.mp3	misery and horror were within that shadow and beyond it nothing that my spirit could look up to i stood for some moments as one stunned and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6130.mp3	reasserted itself and maybe i also got some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the motion of the brig there was yet the buoyancy of vitality in her manner of mounting the seas and that after all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6131.mp3	her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water creaming upon the surges on either hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6132.mp3	by preventing the seas which washed on to the forecastle from cascading with their former violence aft also that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6133.mp3	my eyes directly sought it and found the time twenty minutes after ten this signified that i had ten or eleven hours of darkness before me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6134.mp3	i took down the lamp trimmed it and went to the lazarette hatch at the after end of the cabin here were kept the stores for the crew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6135.mp3	i swallowed half a pannikin of the hollands for the sake of the warmth and life of the draught and entering my cabin put on thick dry stockings first chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6136.mp3	and i then with a seaman's dispatch shifted the rest of my apparel and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6137.mp3	i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it and thus equipped i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6138.mp3	nevertheless its rays suffered me to guess at the picture of ruin the decks offered the main mast was snapped three or four feet above the deck and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6139.mp3	but i now noticed that the weight of the hamper being on the larboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bows fair at the sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6140.mp3	i moved with extreme caution casting the lantern light before me sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6141.mp3	until coming abreast of the main hatch the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body which on my bringing the flame to his face proved to be captain rosy there was a wound over his right brow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6142.mp3	and as if that had not sufficed to slay him the fall of the masts had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round his body binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6143.mp3	that no executioner could have gone more artistically to work to pinion and choke a man under a mass of rigging in the larboard scuppers lay two bodies as i could just faintly discern
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6144.mp3	for they lay under a whole body of shrouds complicated by a mass of other gear against which leaned a portion of the caboose i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead and then with a heart of lead turned away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6145.mp3	i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seaman named abraham wise near the fore hatch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6146.mp3	no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6147.mp3	but the motion of the brig continued very heavy a large swell having been set running by the long fierce gale that was gone and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6148.mp3	i could hear a hundred harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside weighty enough you would have supposed to stave the ship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6149.mp3	nevertheless her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state being as hopeless as the sky was starless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6150.mp3	to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel that she was filling i knew well yet not leaking so rapidly but that had our crew been preserved we might easily have kept her free
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6151.mp3	i had noticed the jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway and so far as i could make out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her she was sound but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6152.mp3	and even had i managed this she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6153.mp3	gloody settles the account a night of fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6154.mp3	the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon i rang my bell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6155.mp3	the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6156.mp3	the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me gloody showed himself at the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6157.mp3	with a face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of cristel if you bring me bad news i said don't keep me waiting for it it's nothing that need trouble you sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6158.mp3	i'm dismissed from my master's service that's all it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside do you believe that i mean well by you i asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6159.mp3	what did he do flew into a furious rage i don't complain of that i daresay i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i can't look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6161.mp3	in this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us two is settled now on both sides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6162.mp3	what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6163.mp3	we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force i said in the meantime gloody i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness he considered a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6164.mp3	the magistrate would put questions to me wouldn't he sir very good you put questions to me and i'll answer them to the best of my ability
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6165.mp3	the investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6166.mp3	the cur had betrayed himself it was a paltry vengeance i own to gratify a malicious pleasure as i did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6167.mp3	to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the cur regarded me he had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6168.mp3	but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6171.mp3	that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6172.mp3	it was borne in on my mind sir and that's all i can tell you he said i didn't dare speak to you about it you wouldn't have believed me or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6173.mp3	the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust miss cristel that she was fond of you i don't mean any offence sir i pretty well guessed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6174.mp3	that she was true as steel and not easily frightened i didn't need to guess i knew it gloody had done his best to prepare cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6175.mp3	she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what a situation for a girl of eighteen

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6177.mp3	how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6178.mp3	i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i went on and your accident in the next room was planned of course i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6179.mp3	i should say no judging by his looks he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall for once in a way he was honest honestly frightened i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6181.mp3	is there anything more i asked that i ought to know only one thing mister roylake that i can think of gloody replied i'm afraid it's miss cristel's turn next what do you mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6182.mp3	while the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and his eye is on miss cristel early this morning sir i happened to be at the boat house somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6183.mp3	i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6184.mp3	had we any proof to justify us gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i searched the boat house no oars no oars

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6212.mp3	which entered the main canyon from either side and that on one occasion an indian anxious to get rid of his wife had her sent adrift in a canoe down through the ice tunnel expecting that she would trouble him no more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6213.mp3	but to his surprise she floated through under the ice in safety all the evidence connected with the present appearance of these two glaciers indicates that they were united and formed a dam across the river

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6226.mp3	i saw fine specimens a hundred and twenty five feet high on deep bottom land a few miles below glenora the tops of some of them were almost covered with dense clusters of yellow and brown cones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6227.mp3	we reached the old hudson's bay trading post at glenora about one o'clock and the captain informed me that he would stop here until the next morning when he would make an early start for wrangell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6228.mp3	at a distance of about seven or eight miles to the northeastward of the landing there is an outstanding group of mountains crowning a spur from the main chain of the coast range whose highest point rises about

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6231.mp3	i thought that by rapid climbing i could reach the summit before sunset in time to get a general view and a few pencil sketches and make my way back to the steamer in the night mister young one of the missionaries asked permission to accompany me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6232.mp3	a fair day's work for a seasoned mountaineer to be done in less than half a day and part of a night but he insisted that he was a strong walker could do a mountaineer's day's work in half a day and would not hinder me in any way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6233.mp3	well i have warned you i said and will not assume responsibility for any trouble that may arise he proved to be a stout walker and we made rapid progress across a brushy timbered flat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6234.mp3	and up the mountain slopes open in some places and in others thatched with dwarf firs resting a minute here and there to refresh ourselves with huckleberries which grew in abundance in open spots about half an hour before sunset
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6235.mp3	when we were near a cluster of crumbling pinnacles that formed the summit i had ceased to feel anxiety about the mountaineering strength and skill of my companion and pushed rapidly on in passing around the shoulder of the highest pinnacle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6236.mp3	where the rock was rapidly disintegrating and the danger of slipping was great i shouted in a warning voice be very careful here this is dangerous mister young was perhaps a dozen or two yards behind me but out of sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6237.mp3	i found however that this was impossible in such a place i therefore tied his arms to his sides with my suspenders and necktie to prevent as much as possible inflammation from movement i then left him telling him to lie still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6238.mp3	to make sure that it was not interrupted by sheer precipices i concluded that with great care and the digging of slight footholds he could be slid down to the glacier where i could lay him on his back and perhaps be able to set his arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6239.mp3	i reached up took hold of him by one of his feet and gently slid him down on his back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6240.mp3	dug heel notches and slid him down to them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6241.mp3	and the glacier was reached perhaps about midnight here i took off one of my boots tied a handkerchief around his wrist for a good hold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6242.mp3	and succeeded in getting one of his arms into place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6243.mp3	i therefore bound it closely to his side and asked him if in his exhausted and trembling condition he was still able to walk yes he bravely replied so with a steadying arm around him and many stops for rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6244.mp3	i marched him slowly down in the starlight on the comparatively smooth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6245.mp3	a distance of perhaps a mile crossed the moraine bathed his head at one of the outlet streams and after many rests reached a dry place and made a brush fire i then went ahead looking for an open way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6246.mp3	and a leafy bed beside it i now told him i would run down the mountain hasten back with help from the boat and carry him down in comfort but he would not hear of my leaving him no no he said i can walk down don't leave me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6247.mp3	i reminded him of the roughness of the way his nerve shaken condition and assured him i would not be gone long but he insisted on trying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6248.mp3	and made him lean on my shoulder while i steadied him to prevent his falling this slow staggering struggle from fire to fire lasted until long after sunrise when at last we reached the ship and stood at the foot of the narrow single plank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6249.mp3	at a considerable angle i briefly explained to mister young's companions who stood looking down at us that he had been hurt in an accident and requested one of them to assist me in getting him aboard but strange to say instead of coming down to help
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6250.mp3	they made haste to reproach him for having gone on a wild goose chase with muir these foolish adventures are well enough for mister muir they said but you mister young have a work to do you have a family you have a church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6251.mp3	and you have no right to risk your life on treacherous peaks and precipices

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6253.mp3	while he went on down the river about his business but when he heard my call for help he hastened forward and elbowed the divines away from the end of the gangplank shouting in angry irreverence oh blank this is no time for preaching
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6254.mp3	then with a man holding down his shoulders we succeeded in getting the bone into its socket notwithstanding the inflammation and contraction of the muscles and ligaments mister young was then put to bed and he slept all the way back to wrangell

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6256.mp3	especially in the church of which nathan is a member as the saddler mounted the steps of his shop he felt the blood so rush along his limbs and tingle in his fingers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6257.mp3	that he could not forbear standing without the door for a moment as if to enjoy the triumph of the warmth within him over the cold morning air the little stone church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6258.mp3	which nathan attends stands in the same square with his shop and nearly opposite it was closed as usual on christmas day and a recent snow had heaped the steps and roof and loaded the windows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6259.mp3	nathan thought that it looked uncommonly beautiful in the softening twilight of the morning while nathan stood musing with his eyes fixed upon the church

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6261.mp3	as to who the stranger could be when he beheld him turn in between the posts by the path that leads to the church tread lightly over the snow and up the steps and knock hastily and vigorously at the church door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6262.mp3	but half recovered from his wonder he was just raising his voice to utter a remonstrance when to his sevenfold amazement the door was opened to the knock and the old man disappeared within
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6263.mp3	it was not without a creeping feeling of awe mingled with his astonishment that nathan gazed upon the door through which this silent figure had vanished but he was not easily to be daunted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6264.mp3	he did not care to follow the steps of the stranger into the church but he remembered a shed so placed against the building near the farther end that he had often when a child at some peril indeed climbed upon its top
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6265.mp3	and looked into the church through a little window at one side of the pulpit for this he started but he did not fail to run across the square and leap over the church gate at the top of his speed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6266.mp3	in order to gather warmth and courage for the attempt when nathan stoddard climbed upon the old shed and pressed his face against the glass of the little church window he had at first only a confused impression
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6267.mp3	as he glared through the darkness into the old kirk of alloway the great chandelier of the church was partly lighted and there were besides many candles and lanterns burning in different parts of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6268.mp3	who were dressed in breeches and ruffled shirts and hooped petticoats and towering head dresses such as he had only seen in old pictures they were mounted upon benches and ladders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6269.mp3	and boards laid along the tops of the pews and were apparently just completing the decoration of the church which was already dressed with green with little trees in the corners and with green letters upon the walls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6270.mp3	the whole party appeared full of life and cheerfulness while the old man whom nathan had seen enter stood near the door looking quietly on with a little girl holding his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6271.mp3	it was not until nathan stoddard had looked for some little time upon this spectacle that he began to feel that he was witness of any thing more than natural the whole party had so home like an air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6272.mp3	the more he was filled for all their appearance of youth and their simple manners with a strange sort of veneration the sweet and cheerful faces of the young women seemed to grow awfully calm

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6429.mp3	coonskin's opinion didn't benefit pod much his hard wood fire wasn't very satisfactory but with some dry brush the men got the meal under way next morning we visited the noted petrified stump

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6432.mp3	several times i had a suspicion that we had been misdirected when we came to the end of a narrow wood road i was sure of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6433.mp3	best to go through the woods said the valet so we were headed for the timber our tramp through the forest i cannot soon forget up and down the rocky heights through thickets of quaking asp and pine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6434.mp3	and realized we were lost coonskin said he was an experienced woodman and would blaze the trees so we would get out again wonderful the amount of learning he had gleaned from dime novels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6435.mp3	he lagged behind to do the blazing and pretty soon i smelt smoke the professor snuffed smells as if the woods were on fire somewhere hinted pod look behind you they are i exclaimed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6436.mp3	and pod caught that erudite valet back woodsman in the act of setting a tree on fire with oil and matches fortunately for us the wind wasn't blowing strong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6437.mp3	but we had to change our course some and hustle faster for the blazing trail chased us coonskin learned a new lesson and turned down the corner of the page so he'd recollect it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6438.mp3	a board sign informed us it was simply turkey creek i couldn't see any turkeys but there was good pasturage around the hot trip through the timber made us all hungry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6439.mp3	it was three o'clock when we donks were picketed and allowed to graze then coonskin went fishing he said he had seen some trout in the stream by supper time he had caught a nice mess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6440.mp3	pod said he would fry the fish and went at it so enthusiastically that he forgot to put the bag of corn meal back in its place after the meal was over he began to look around for the bag it was nowhere to be found
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6441.mp3	i had eaten the corn meal and bag it was comical how those two men puzzled their brains about that missing commodity when coonskin detected some meal stamped in the ground pod pointed at me and said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6442.mp3	that's the thief there next morning coonskin was the first to return from fishing and looked much excited when pod returned he told him he had seen huge bear tracks he was going bear hunting pod laughed at him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6443.mp3	that was my experience in the woods of wisconsin the men at the saw mill said we should see bear in this forest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6444.mp3	its skin would fetch fifty dollars or more let's look for bear what would you do if you saw a bear pod asked well now leave that to me said coonskin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6445.mp3	in the first place it would be worth a hairbreadth escape to see one wild i've only seen bears in circuses or traveling chained to italians in the second place i can run i've plenty of medals for sprinting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6446.mp3	pod went fishing that afternoon with a gun and took the whole arsenal along with him including the axe somewhere about five o'clock pod came into camp with a good mess of trout after cleaning the fish he took off his guns
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6447.mp3	and laid down on the grass and wondered if that crazy valet had run across any more bear tracks he wasn't there long when suddenly i heard yells issuing from the canyon down stream round the bend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6448.mp3	the shouting sounded nearer every second and i soon distinguished coonskin's voice pod got up from the ground excitedly coonskin's in trouble plain enough said pod aloud to himself i must run to his aid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6449.mp3	so he started on a trot down stream to the bend and then quickly turned falling all over himself and ran toward the cabins faster than i ever saw him run before or since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6450.mp3	and immediately coonskin came flying into view with the biggest bear at his heels i ever want to see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6451.mp3	their sharp cur like barks used often to rouse us and of a dark evening we would hear them out in the fields mousing around the stone heaps making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6452.mp3	to call the real mice out of their grass nests inside the stone heaps this indeed is a favorite trick of reynard at the time of my story my friend tom edwards ten years of age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6453.mp3	and myself were in the turkey business equal partners we owned a flock of thirty one turkeys these roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of tom's house in the very top of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6454.mp3	and by day they wandered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beech nuts which were very plentiful that fall all went well till the last week in october when on taking the census one morning a turkey was found to be missing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6455.mp3	the thirty one had become thirty since nightfall the previous evening it was the first one we had lost we proceeded to look for traces our suspicions were divided
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6456.mp3	tom thought it was the twombly boys nefarious sam in particular i thought it might have been an owl but under the tree in the soft dirt where the potatoes had recently been dug we found fox tracks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6457.mp3	and two or three ominous little wads of feathers with one long tail feather adrift thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butternut had a fit perhaps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6458.mp3	and a casualty such as turkey raisers are unavoidably heirs to and we bore our loss with resignation we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roosts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6459.mp3	this theory received something of a check when our flock counted only twenty nine the next morning there were more fox tracks and a great many more feathers under the tree this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6460.mp3	no algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate together with our prospective profits in the light of this new fact it was clear that something must be done and at once too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6461.mp3	or ruin would swallow up the poultry firm rightly or wrongly we attributed the mischief to a certain silver gray that had several times been seen in the neighborhood that autumn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6462.mp3	it would take far too much space to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch that fox during the next two weeks i recollect that we set three traps for him to no purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6463.mp3	had succeeded in getting two more of the turkeys heroes it is said are born of great crises this dilemma of ours developed tom's genius i'll have that fox he said when the traps failed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6464.mp3	each a wad of fine dry grass as large as a quart box these were gathered up and filled the great basket there said he triumphantly don't them smell mousey they did certainly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6465.mp3	they savored as strongly of mice as tom's question of bad grammar and don't foxes catch mice demanded tom confidently yes but i don't see how that's going to catch the fox i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6466.mp3	well look here then i'll show ye said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6467.mp3	and you was prowling around the fields go off now out there by that stump full of wonder and curiosity i retired to the stump tom meantime turned out the mass of nests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6468.mp3	and with it completely covered himself the pile now resembled an enormous mouse nest or rather a small hay cock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6469.mp3	inside the nest evidently there were mice in it and feeling my character as fox at stake i at once trotted forward then crept up and as the rustling and squeaking continued made a pounce into the grass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6470.mp3	as i had heard it said that foxes did when mousing instantly two spry brown hands from out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip as a fox i struggled tremendously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6471.mp3	then in dumb show knocked my head with a stone d'ye see now he demanded i saw but a fox would bite you i objected let him bite said tom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6472.mp3	with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stone heaps were and where we had oftenest heard foxes bark selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry briars which grew about a great pine stump
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6473.mp3	tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the contents of the big basket he then practiced squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all was in good trim his squeaks were perfect successes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6474.mp3	made by sucking the air sharply betwixt his teeth now be off said tom and don't come poking around nor get in sight till you hear me holler
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6475.mp3	and being amidst nice cozy straw i presently went to sleep quite unintentionally i must have slept some time though it seemed to me but a very few minutes what woke me was a noise a sharp suppressed yelp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6476.mp3	it took me a moment to understand where i was and why i was there a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground at some distance assisted my wandering wits and i rushed out of the barn and ran toward the field
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6477.mp3	as i ran two or three dull whacks came to my ear got him tom i shouted rushing up tom was holding and squeezing one of his hands with the other and shaking it violently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6478.mp3	he said not a word and left me to poke about and stumble on the limp warm carcass of a large fox that lay near bite ye i exclaimed after satisfying myself that the fox was dead some said tom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6479.mp3	and that was all i could get from him that night we took the fox to the house and lighted a candle it was the silver gray tom washed his bite in cold water and went to bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6480.mp3	his left hand was bitten through the palm and badly swollen there was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm just below the elbow several minor nips in his left leg above the knee and a ragged grab
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6481.mp3	these numerous bites however were followed by no serious ill effects the next day tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass that he had caught hold of one of its hind legs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6482.mp3	i just determined to have it out with him considering the fact that a fox is a very active sharp biting animal and that this was an unusually large male i have always thought tom got off very well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6483.mp3	i do not think that he ever cared to make a fox trap of himself again however we sold the fox skin in the village and received thirteen dollars for it whereas a common red fox skin is worth no more than three dollars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6484.mp3	how or by what wiles that fox got the turkeys out of the high butternut is a secret

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6513.mp3	i found the store full of loungers who patronized the chairs soap and starch boxes mackerel kits and counter forming a silent circle round a towering stove in the center
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6514.mp3	the village treasurer wore a boiled shirt and brass collar buttons but no collar or coat his companions were generally attired in flannel shirts of different hues and patterns

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6517.mp3	and only this morning ate two chickens and a duck and chased a farmer into his hay loft but he doesn't bite my statement had a sensational effect on the assembly who one by one sneaked out of the door

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6520.mp3	to be good chocolate must be well dissolved no pot was to be had save a flower pot with a hole in the bottom a great idea popped into my head

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6524.mp3	something within was sizzling and brewing and steaming gas and steam choked me i was sure there was going to be a demonstration in my honor that i had not bargained for the yeast cake came to mind then i knew the cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6525.mp3	after which i excused myself to the clerk and went to bed and dreamed i was being cremated alive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6526.mp3	and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard said chebec proudly slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6527.mp3	he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of chebec's did you say your fighting cousin he asked in a hesitating way that's what i said replied chebec he is scrapper the kingbird as of course you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6528.mp3	the rest of us always feel safe when he is about of course i know him declared peter his face clearing where is he now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6529.mp3	at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction screaming at the top of their voices
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6530.mp3	of course peter couldn't be left out of anything like that and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6531.mp3	and this way and that way as if trying to get away from something or somebody for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with redtail and then he saw
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6532.mp3	a white throated white breasted bird having a black cap and back and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at redtail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6533.mp3	he was just a little smaller than welcome robin and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that is who it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6534.mp3	he wasn't afraid and he intended that everybody should know it especially redtail it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs calling redtail a robber and every other bad name he could think of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6535.mp3	all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names but none not even bully the english sparrow was brave enough to join him in attacking big redtail when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6536.mp3	scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6537.mp3	peter couldn't help but admire scrapper for his courage as peter looked up at scrapper he saw that like all the rest of the flycatchers there was just the tiniest of hooks on the end of his bill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6538.mp3	scrapper's slightly raised cap seemed all black but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red while peter sat staring up at him scrapper suddenly darted out into the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6539.mp3	and his bill snapped in quite the same way chebec's did when he caught a fly but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had it was a bee peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6540.mp3	it reminded peter that he had often heard scrapper called the bee martin and now he understood why do you live on bees altogether asked peter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6541.mp3	there wouldn't be any honey if i did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6542.mp3	those that i do catch are mostly drones and you know the drones are useless they do no work at all it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some that don't
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6543.mp3	i'm one of farmer brown's best friends if he did but know it you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family but if any one of them has better eyesight than i have i'd like to know who it is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6544.mp3	there's a fly way over there beyond that old apple tree watch me catch it peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly he knew that he couldn't have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6545.mp3	but if he couldn't see the fly he could hear the sharp click of scrapper's bill and he knew by the way scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return that he had caught that fly and it had tasted good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6546.mp3	are you going to build in the old orchard this year asked peter of course i am declared scrapper i just then he spied blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6547.mp3	turning away toward the green meadows instead peter didn't wait for scrapper to return
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6548.mp3	just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard some one called him peter oh peter rabbit called the voice peter stopped abruptly sat up very straight looked this way looked that way and looked the other way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6549.mp3	every way but the right way look up over your head cried the voice rather a harsh voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6550.mp3	it was cresty the great crested flycatcher he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the kingbird yet not quite so big as welcome robin and more slender
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6551.mp3	his throat and breast were gray shading into bright yellow underneath his back and head were of a grayish brown with a tint of olive green a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6552.mp3	you seem to be in a hurry so don't let me detain you peter said cresty before peter could find his tongue i just want to ask one little favor of you what is it asked peter who
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6553.mp3	if in your roaming about you run across an old cast off suit of mister black snake or of any other member of the snake family i wish you would remember me and let me know will you peter said cresty a a
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6554.mp3	a what stammered peter a cast off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied cresty somewhat impatiently now don't forget peter i've got to go house hunting but you'll find me there or hereabouts if it happens that you find one of those
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6555.mp3	cast off snake suits before peter could say another word cresty had flown away peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch and then towards jenny wren's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6556.mp3	he just couldn't understand about those cast off suits of the snake family and he felt sure that jenny wren could tell him finally curiosity got the best of him and back he scampered lipperty lipperty lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny wren had her home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6557.mp3	jenny called peter jenny wren jenny wren no one answered him he could hear mister wren singing in another tree but he couldn't see him jenny jenny wren jenny wren called peter again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6558.mp3	this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes fairly snapped didn't i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed didn't i tell you that i've got seven eggs in here and that i can't spend any time gossiping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6559.mp3	didn't i peter rabbit didn't i didn't i you certainly did jenny you certainly did and i'm sorry to disturb you replied peter meekly i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing but i just didn't know who else to go to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6560.mp3	go to for what snapped jenny wren what is it you've come to me for snake skins replied peter snake skins snake skins shrieked jenny wren
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6561.mp3	you don't understand cried peter hurriedly what i want to know is why should cresty the flycatcher ask me to please let him know if i found any cast off suits of the snake family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6562.mp3	he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you because i know you know everything especially everything concerning your neighbors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6563.mp3	with this jenny wren disappeared inside her house and there was nothing for peter to do but once more start for the dear old briar patch on his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest which was just beyond the old orchard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6564.mp3	he just had to find out if there was anything new over there hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying pee wee pee wee pee wee peter chuckled happily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6565.mp3	he usually is one of the last of the flycatcher family to arrive i didn't expect to find him yet i wonder what has brought him up so early
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6566.mp3	it didn't take peter long to find pewee he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw pewee fly out and make the same kind of a little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6567.mp3	it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady rather lonely part of the green forest almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintive tone pee wee pee wee pee wee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6568.mp3	but he wasn't sad as peter well knew it was his way of expressing how happy he felt he was a little bigger than his cousin chebec but looked very much like him there was a little notch in the end of his tail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6569.mp3	the upper half of his bill was black but the lower half was light peter could see on each wing two whitish bars and he noticed that pewee's wings were longer than his tail which wasn't the case with chebec
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6570.mp3	but no one could ever mistake pewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over aren't you here early asked peter pewee nodded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6571.mp3	that is something i don't often do if you please peter inquired politely why do folks call you wood pewee pewee chuckled happily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6572.mp3	it is so quiet and restful that i love it missus pewee and i are very retiring we do not like too many near neighbors you won't mind if i come to see you once in a while will you asked peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6573.mp3	come as often as you like replied pewee the oftener the better back in the old briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the flycatcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6574.mp3	that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6575.mp3	but most of all peter thought about that queer request of cresty's and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mister black snake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6576.mp3	it was such a funny thing for cresty to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mister sun had kicked his bedclothes off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6577.mp3	jenny wren was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way and that way in that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast she talked jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6578.mp3	then as peter shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of snake skin in their nest said she why they want it goodness knows but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6579.mp3	perhaps they think it will scare robbers away as for me i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that i have to admit that cresty and his wife are a handsome couple
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6580.mp3	and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking but snake skins ugh by the way where does cresty build asked peter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6581.mp3	in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny wren promptly peter looked quite as surprised as he felt does cresty make the hole he asked goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny wren
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6582.mp3	where are your eyes peter did you ever see a flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood she didn't wait for a reply but rattled on it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses look
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6583.mp3	there is downy the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute that's good i like to see that it means that next year there will be one more house for some one here in the old orchard for myself i prefer old houses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6584.mp3	i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it there is something settled about an old house it doesn't attract attention the way a new one does so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6585.mp3	the older it is the better it suits me but the woodpeckers seem to like new houses best which as i said before is a very good thing for the rest of us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6586.mp3	winsome bluebird stupid snapped jenny wren peter grinned and looked foolish of course said he i forgot all about winsome and skimmer the tree swallow added jenny that's so i ought to have remembered him exclaimed peter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6587.mp3	i've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year is there anybody else again jenny wren nodded yank yank the nuthatch uses an old house i'm told but he usually goes up north for his nesting said she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6588.mp3	tommy tit the chickadee sometimes uses an old house then again he and missus chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves yellow wing the flicker who really is a woodpecker often uses an old house but quite often makes a new one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6589.mp3	then there are killy the sparrow hawk and spooky the screech owl peter looked surprised i didn't suppose they nested in holes in trees he exclaimed they certainly do more's the pity snapped jenny
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6590.mp3	it would be a good thing for the rest of us if they didn't nest at all but they do and an old house of yellow wing the flicker suits either of them killy always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6591.mp3	spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable he lives in it more or less the year around now i must get back to those eggs of mine i've talked quite enough for one morning oh jenny cried peter as a sudden thought struck him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6592.mp3	jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently well what is it now she demanded have you got two homes asked peter goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6593.mp3	one is all i can take care of then why demanded peter triumphantly does mister wren work all day carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree it seems to me that he has carried enough in there to build two or three nests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6594.mp3	he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6595.mp3	i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird redwing was one of the first birds to arrive and i've neglected him shamefully when peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6596.mp3	off he started lipperty lipperty lip for the smiling pool he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6597.mp3	bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point the ground was soft in places quite muddy peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp so he hopped along carelessly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6598.mp3	from right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6599.mp3	he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes then peter chuckled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6600.mp3	he scared me for a second then you are even said a voice close at hand you scared him i saw you coming but longbill didn't peter turned quickly there was missus woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6601.mp3	i didn't mean to scare him apologized peter i really didn't mean to do you think he was really very much scared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6602.mp3	i recognized you just as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes so i came right back i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6603.mp3	i am glad it is no one but you peter for i was having a splendid meal here and i should have hated to leave it you'll excuse me while i go on eating i hope we can talk between bites
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6604.mp3	certainly i'll excuse you replied peter staring around very hard to see what it could be longbill was making such a good meal of but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6605.mp3	longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion peter had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6606.mp3	he was quite a little bigger than welcome robin his tail was short his legs were short and his neck was short but his bill was long enough to make up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6607.mp3	his back was a mixture of gray brown black and buff while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff it was his head that made him look queer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6608.mp3	his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him suddenly longbill plunged his bill into the ground he plunged it in for the whole length
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6609.mp3	then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbill's throat where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6610.mp3	for the first time peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about did you make all those little round holes exclaimed peter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6611.mp3	and was there a worm in every one asked peter his eyes very wide with interest longbill nodded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6612.mp3	peter remembered how he had watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6613.mp3	while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6614.mp3	and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in asked peter longbill chuckled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6615.mp3	longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him and to peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all that's the way i get them said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6616.mp3	i think there is one right under my feet now watch me get him longbill bored into the ground until his head was almost against it when he pulled his bill out sure enough there was a worm of course explained longbill it is only in soft ground that i can do this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6617.mp3	that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes at all it's wonderful sighed peter i don't suppose any one else can find hidden worms that way my cousin jack snipe can replied longbill promptly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6618.mp3	he feeds the same way i do only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps perhaps you know him peter nodded i do said he now you speak of it there is a strong family resemblance although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6619.mp3	now i must be running along i'm ever so glad to have seen you and i'm coming over to call again the first chance i get so peter said good by and kept on down the laughing brook to the smiling pool right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6620.mp3	there was a little pebbly beach running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs a long slender bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6621.mp3	every few steps he would stop to pick up something then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6622.mp3	it was teeter the spotted sandpiper an old friend of peter's peter greeted him joyously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6623.mp3	before peter could say another word teeter came running towards him and it was plain to see that teeter was very anxious about something don't move peter rabbit don't move he cried why not demanded peter for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6624.mp3	just then missus teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter thank goodness exclaimed teeter still bobbing and bowing if you had taken another step peter rabbit you would have stepped right on our eggs you gave me a dreadful start
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6625.mp3	missus teeter stood up and stepped aside then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for a lining four white eggs with big dark blotches on them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6626.mp3	they looked so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world but for missus teeter peter hastily backed away a few steps missus teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6627.mp3	it suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it he wouldn't have known she was there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6628.mp3	my he exclaimed i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me said he i'm so thankful i didn't i don't see how you dare lay them in the open like this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6629.mp3	which was the big news of the day and how could i not have been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6630.mp3	this mystery puzzled me finding it impossible to form any views i drifted from one extreme to the other something was out there that much was certain and any doubting thomas was invited to place his finger on the scotia's wound when i arrived in new york
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6631.mp3	also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage and again because of this speed of movement so only two possible solutions to the question were left creating two very distinct groups of supporters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6632.mp3	it couldn't stand up to inquiries conducted in both the new world and the old that a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal was less than probable where and when had he built it and how could he have built it in secret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6633.mp3	only some government could own such an engine of destruction and in these disaster filled times when men tax their ingenuity to build increasingly powerful aggressive weapons it was possible that unknown to the rest of the world some nation could have been testing such a fearsome machine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6634.mp3	and the torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram which in turn will lead to the world putting its foot down at least i hope it will but this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials from the various governments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6635.mp3	since the public interest was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6636.mp3	besides how could the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6637.mp3	so after inquiries conducted in england france russia prussia spain italy america and even turkey the hypothesis of an underwater monitor was ultimately rejected and so the monster surfaced again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6638.mp3	despite the endless witticisms heaped on it by the popular press
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6639.mp3	after i arrived in new york several people did me the honor of consulting me on the phenomenon in question in france i had published a two volume work in quarto entitled the mysteries of the great ocean depths well received in scholarly circles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6640.mp3	my views were in demand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6641.mp3	i confined myself to a flat no comment but soon pinned to the wall i had to explain myself straight out and in this vein the honorable pierre aronnax professor at the paris museum was summoned by the new york herald to formulate his views no matter what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6642.mp3	i complied since i could no longer hold my tongue i let it wag i discussed the question in its every aspect both political and scientific and this is an excerpt from the well padded article i published in the issue of april thirtieth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6643.mp3	therefore i wrote after examining these different hypotheses one by one we are forced every other supposition having been refuted to accept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6644.mp3	the deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us no soundings have been able to reach them what goes on in those distant depths what creatures inhabit or could inhabit those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6645.mp3	what is the constitution of these animals it's almost beyond conjecture however the solution to this problem submitted to me can take the form of a choice between two alternatives either we know every variety of creature populating our planet or we do not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6646.mp3	if we do not know every one of them if nature still keeps ichthyological secrets from us nothing is more admissible than to accept the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new genera animals with a basically cast iron constitution
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6647.mp3	that inhabit strata beyond the reach of our soundings and which some development or other an urge or a whim if you prefer can bring to the upper level of the ocean for long intervals if on the other hand we do know every living species
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6648.mp3	we must look for the animal in question among those marine creatures already cataloged and in this event i would be inclined to accept the existence of a giant narwhale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6649.mp3	increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold then give this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its offensive weapons and you have the animal we're looking for it would have the proportions determined by the officers of the shannon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6650.mp3	the instrument needed to perforate the scotia and the power to pierce a steamer's hull in essence the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword or lance as certain naturalists have expressed it it's a king sized tooth as hard as steel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6651.mp3	which the narwhale attacks with invariable success others have been wrenched not without difficulty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6652.mp3	owns one of these tusks with a length of two point two five meters and a width at its base of forty eight centimeters all right then imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and the animal ten times more powerful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6653.mp3	launch it at a speed of twenty miles per hour multiply its mass times its velocity and you get just the collision we need to cause the specified catastrophe so until information becomes more abundant i plump for a sea unicorn of colossal dimensions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6654.mp3	no longer armed with a mere lance but with an actual spur like ironclad frigates or those warships called rams whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously this inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6655.mp3	these last words were cowardly of me but as far as i could i wanted to protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open to laughter from the americans who when they do laugh laugh raucously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6656.mp3	i had left myself a loophole yet deep down i had accepted the existence of the monster my article was hotly debated causing a fine old uproar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6657.mp3	moreover the solution it proposed allowed for free play of the imagination the human mind enjoys impressive visions of unearthly creatures now then the sea is precisely their best medium
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6658.mp3	our creator cast them using a colossal mold that time has gradually made smaller with its untold depths couldn't the sea keep alive such huge specimens of life from another age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6659.mp3	continuous alteration couldn't the heart of the ocean hide the last remaining varieties of these titanic species for whom years are centuries and centuries millennia but i mustn't let these fantasies run away with me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6660.mp3	enough of these fairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities i repeat opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon and the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious creature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6661.mp3	yet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved more practical people especially in america and england were determined to purge the ocean of this daunting monster to insure the safety of transoceanic travel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6662.mp3	the shipping and mercantile gazette the lloyd's list france's packetboat and maritime and colonial review all the rags devoted to insurance companies who threatened to raise their premium rates were unanimous on this point
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6663.mp3	the naval arsenals were unlocked for commander farragut who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate but as it always happens just when a decision had been made to chase the monster the monster put in no further appearances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6664.mp3	for two months nobody heard a word about it not a single ship encountered it apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven around it people were constantly babbling about the creature even via the atlantic cable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6665.mp3	accordingly the wags claimed that this slippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making the most of it so the frigate was equipped for a far off voyage and armed with fearsome fishing gear but nobody knew where to steer it and impatience grew until on june second
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6666.mp3	word came that the tampico a steamer on the san francisco line sailing from california to shanghai had sighted the animal again three weeks before in the northerly seas of the pacific this news caused intense excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6667.mp3	not even a twenty four hour breather was granted to commander farragut his provisions were loaded on board his coal bunkers were overflowing not a crewman was missing from his post to cast off he needed only to fire and stoke his furnaces half a day's delay would have been unforgivable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6668.mp3	chapter five at random for some while the voyage of the abraham lincoln was marked by no incident but one circumstance arose that displayed ned land's marvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could place in him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6669.mp3	off the falkland islands on june thirtieth the frigate came in contact with a fleet of american whalers and we learned that they hadn't seen the narwhale but one of them the captain of the monroe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6670.mp3	anxious to see ned land at work commander farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the monroe and the canadian had such good luck that with a right and left shot he harpooned not one whale but two striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other after a few minutes chase
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6671.mp3	assuredly if the monster ever had to deal with ned land's harpoon i wouldn't bet on the monster the frigate sailed along the east coast of south america with prodigious speed by july third we were at the entrance to the strait of magellan abreast of cabo de las virgenes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6672.mp3	and maneuvered instead to double cape horn the crew sided with him unanimously indeed were we likely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait many of our sailors swore that the monster couldn't negotiate this passageway simply because he's too big for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6673.mp3	near three o'clock in the afternoon on july sixth fifteen miles south of shore the abraham lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of the south american continent that stray rock dutch seamen had named cape horn after their hometown of hoorn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6674.mp3	our course was set for the northwest and the next day our frigate's propeller finally churned the waters of the pacific open your eyes open your eyes repeated the sailors of the abraham lincoln and they opened amazingly wide eyes and spyglasses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6675.mp3	a bit dazzled it is true by the vista of two thousand dollars didn't remain at rest for an instant day and night we observed the surface of the ocean and those with nyctalopic eyes whose ability to see in the dark increased their chances by fifty percent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6676.mp3	i no longer left the ship's deck sometimes bending over the forecastle railings sometimes leaning against the sternrail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6677.mp3	and how many times i shared the excitement of general staff and crew when some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the waves in an instant the frigate's deck would become densely populated the cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of sailors and officers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6678.mp3	with panting chests and anxious eyes we each would observe the cetacean's movements i stared i stared until i nearly went blind from a worn out retina while conseil as stoic as ever kept repeating to me in a calm tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6679.mp3	if master's eyes would kindly stop bulging master will see farther but what a waste of energy the abraham lincoln would change course and race after the animal sighted only to find an ordinary baleen whale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6680.mp3	or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid a chorus of curses however the weather held good our voyage was proceeding under the most favorable conditions by then it was the bad season in these southernmost regions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6681.mp3	because july in this zone corresponds to our january in europe but the sea remained smooth and easily visible over a vast perimeter ned land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6682.mp3	but this stubborn canadian spent eight hours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin a hundred times i chided him for his unconcern bah he replied nothing's out there professor aronnax
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6683.mp3	and if there is some animal what chance would we have of spotting it can't you see we're just wandering around at random people say they've sighted this slippery beast again in the pacific high seas i'm truly willing to believe it but two months have already gone by since then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6684.mp3	and judging by your narwhale's personality it hates growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways it's blessed with a terrific gift for getting around now professor you know even better than i that nature doesn't violate good sense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6685.mp3	these bearings determined the frigate took a more decisive westward heading and tackled the seas of the central pacific commander farragut felt and with good reason that it was best to stay in deep waters and keep his distance from continents or islands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6686.mp3	no doubt our bosun said because there isn't enough water for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6687.mp3	then cut the tropic of cancer at longitude one hundred thirty two degrees and headed for the seas of china we were finally in the area of the monster's latest antics and in all honesty shipboard conditions became life threatening hearts were pounding hideously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6688.mp3	nobody ate nobody slept twenty times a day some error in perception or the optical illusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees would cause intolerable anguish and this emotion repeated twenty times over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6689.mp3	kept us in a state of irritability so intense that a reaction was bound to follow and this reaction wasn't long in coming for three months during which each day seemed like a century the abraham lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the pacific
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6690.mp3	racing after whales sighted abruptly veering off course swerving sharply from one tack to another stopping suddenly putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession at the risk of stripping its gears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6691.mp3	and it didn't leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of japan to the coasts of america and we found nothing nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale or an underwater islet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6692.mp3	and each man now wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping to make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrificed with typical human fickleness they jumped from one extreme to the other inevitably the most enthusiastic supporters of the undertaking became its most energetic opponents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6693.mp3	this reaction mounted upward from the bowels of the ship from the quarters of the bunker hands to the messroom of the general staff and for certain if it hadn't been for commander farragut's characteristic stubbornness the frigate would ultimately have put back to that cape in the south
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6694.mp3	never had the crew of an american naval craft shown more patience and zeal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6695.mp3	a request to this effect was presented to the commander the commander stood his ground his sailors couldn't hide their discontent and their work suffered because of it i'm unwilling to say that there was mutiny on board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6696.mp3	and the abraham lincoln would chart a course toward european seas this promise was given on november second it had the immediate effect of reviving the crew's failing spirits the ocean was observed with renewed care
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6697.mp3	each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his experience spyglasses functioned with feverish energy a supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale and the latter had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this summons to appear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6698.mp3	two days passed the abraham lincoln stayed at half steam
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6699.mp3	a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its apathy enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake to the great satisfaction i must say of assorted sharks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6700.mp3	while the abraham lincoln heaved to its longboats radiated in every direction around it and didn't leave a single point of the sea unexplored but the evening of november fourth arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6701.mp3	by then the frigate lay in latitude thirty one degrees fifteen north and longitude one hundred thirty six degrees forty two east the shores of japan were less than two hundred miles to our leeward night was coming on eight o'clock had just struck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6702.mp3	huge clouds covered the moon's disk then in its first quarter the sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate's stempost just then i was in the bow leaning over the starboard rail conseil stationed beside me stared straight ahead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6703.mp3	roosting in the shrouds the crew examined the horizon which shrank and darkened little by little officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6704.mp3	then all traces of light vanished into the darkness observing conseil i discovered that just barely the gallant lad had fallen under the general influence at least so i thought perhaps his nerves were twitching with curiosity for the first time in history
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6705.mp3	come on conseil i told him here's your last chance to pocket that two thousand dollars if master will permit my saying so conseil replied i never expected to win that prize
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6706.mp3	in master's little apartment conseil answered in master's museum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6707.mp3	and it would have attracted every curiosity seeker in town quite so conseil and what's more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6708.mp3	to be sure conseil replied serenely i do think they'll have fun at master's expense and must it be said it must be said conseil well then it will serve master right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6709.mp3	how true when one has the honor of being an expert as master is one mustn't lay himself open to conseil didn't have time to complete the compliment in the midst of the general silence a voice became audible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6710.mp3	chapter three as master wishes three seconds before the arrival of j b hobson's letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6711.mp3	i understood at last that my true vocation my sole purpose in life was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6712.mp3	i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections but now nothing could hold me back i forgot everything else and without another thought of exhaustion friends or collections
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6713.mp3	i accepted the american government's offer besides i mused all roads lead home to europe and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of france that fine animal may even let itself be captured in european seas as a personal favor to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6714.mp3	conseil i called in an impatient voice conseil was my manservant a devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys a gallant flemish boy whom i genuinely liked and who returned the compliment a born stoic punctilious on principle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6715.mp3	habitually hardworking rarely startled by life's surprises very skillful with his hands efficient in his every duty and despite his having a name that means counsel never giving advice not even the unsolicited kind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6716.mp3	from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two in conseil i had a seasoned specialist in biological classification an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6717.mp3	up and down the whole ladder of branches groups classes subclasses orders families genera subgenera species and varieties but there his science came to a halt classifying was everything to him so he knew nothing else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6718.mp3	well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly versed in its practical application and i doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale and yet what a fine gallant lad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6719.mp3	for the past ten years conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever china or the congo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6720.mp3	no matter how far off it was he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment moreover he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments owned solid muscles but hadn't a nerve in him not a sign of nerves the mental type i mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6721.mp3	the lad was thirty years old and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting i had turned forty but conseil had one flaw he was a fanatic on formality
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6722.mp3	and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome conseil i repeated while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure to be sure i had confidence in this devoted lad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6723.mp3	there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most emotionless man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6724.mp3	conseil i called a third time conseil appeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6725.mp3	yes my boy get my things ready get yours ready we're departing in two hours as master wishes conseil replied serenely we haven't a moment to lose pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6727.mp3	certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour whatever detour master wishes oh it's nothing really a route slightly less direct that's all we're leaving on the abraham lincoln
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6728.mp3	as master thinks best conseil replied placidly you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious narwhale we're going to rid the seas of it the author of a two volume work in quarto on the mysteries of the great ocean depths
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6729.mp3	it's a glorious mission but also a dangerous one

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6731.mp3	as master wishes a quarter of an hour later our trunks were ready conseil did them in a flash and i was sure the lad hadn't missed a thing because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6732.mp3	the hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine i went down a short stair leading to the ground floor

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6737.mp3	the same i replied commander farragut in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you i bowed and letting the commander attend to getting under way i was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6738.mp3	the abraham lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen point three miles per hour a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean the frigate's interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues i was well satisfied with my cabin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6739.mp3	which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mess we'll be quite comfortable here i told conseil with all due respect to master conseil replied as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6740.mp3	just then commander farragut was giving orders to cast off the last moorings holding the abraham lincoln to its brooklyn pier and so if i'd been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6741.mp3	the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism but commander farragut didn't want to waste a single day

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6749.mp3	the flying stars the most beautiful crime i ever committed flambeau would say in his highly moral old age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6750.mp3	was also by a singular coincidence my last it was committed at christmas as an artist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6751.mp3	i had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which i found myself choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe as if for a statuary group
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6752.mp3	thus squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak while jews on the other hand should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6755.mp3	which is almost impossible it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars and those solemn plains of gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of millet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6756.mp3	well my last crime was a christmas crime a cheery cosy english middle class crime a crime of charles dickens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6757.mp3	i did it in a good old middle class house near putney a house with a crescent of carriage drive a house with a stable by the side of it a house with the name on the two outer gates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6758.mp3	a house with a monkey tree enough you know the species i really think my imitation of dickens's style was dexterous and literary it seems almost a pity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6759.mp3	i repented the same evening flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside and even from the inside it was odd seen from the outside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6760.mp3	it was perfectly incomprehensible and it is from the outside that the stranger must study it from this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when the front doors of the house with the stable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6761.mp3	opened on the garden with the monkey tree and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the afternoon of boxing day she had a pretty face with brave brown eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6762.mp3	but her figure was beyond conjecture for she was so wrapped up in brown furs that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur but for the attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6763.mp3	the winter afternoon was reddening towards evening and already a ruby light was rolled over the bloomless beds filling them as it were with the ghosts of the dead roses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6764.mp3	on one side of the house stood the stable on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden behind the young lady having scattered bread for the birds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6765.mp3	for the fourth or fifth time that day because the dog ate it passed unobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glimmering plantation of evergreens behind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6766.mp3	here she gave an exclamation of wonder real or ritual and looking up at the high garden wall above her beheld it fantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6767.mp3	oh don't jump mister crook she called out in some alarm it's much too high the individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6768.mp3	was a tall angular young man with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush intelligent and even distinguished lineaments but a sallow and almost alien complexion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6769.mp3	this showed the more plainly because he wore an aggressive red tie the only part of his costume of which he seemed to take any care perhaps it was a symbol
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6770.mp3	he took no notice of the girl's alarmed adjuration but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside her where he might very well have broken his legs i think i was meant to be a burglar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6771.mp3	he said placidly and i have no doubt i should have been if i hadn't happened to be born in that nice house next door i can't see any harm in it anyhow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6772.mp3	how can you say such things she remonstrated well said the young man if you're born on the wrong side of the wall i can't see that it's wrong to climb over it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6773.mp3	i never know what you will say or do next she said i don't often know myself replied mister crook but then i am on the right side of the wall now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6774.mp3	and which is the right side of the wall asked the young lady smiling whichever side you are on said the young man named crook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6775.mp3	as they went together through the laurels towards the front garden a motor horn sounded thrice coming nearer and nearer and a car of splendid speed great elegance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6776.mp3	and stood throbbing hullo hullo said the young man with the red tie here's somebody born on the right side anyhow i didn't know miss adams that your santa claus was so modern as this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6777.mp3	oh that's my godfather sir leopold fischer he always comes on boxing day then after an innocent pause which unconsciously betrayed some lack of enthusiasm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6778.mp3	ruby adams added he is very kind john crook journalist had heard of that eminent city magnate and it was not his fault if the city magnate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6779.mp3	had not heard of him for in certain articles in the clarion or the new age sir leopold had been dealt with austerely but he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the motor car
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6780.mp3	which was rather a long process a large neat chauffeur in green got out from the front and a small neat manservant in grey got out from the back and between them they deposited sir leopold on the doorstep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6781.mp3	and began to unpack him like some very carefully protected parcel rugs enough to stock a bazaar furs of all the beasts of the forest and scarves of all the colours of the rainbow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6782.mp3	were unwrapped one by one till they revealed something resembling the human form the form of a friendly but foreign looking old gentleman with a grey goat like beard and a beaming smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6783.mp3	who rubbed his big fur gloves together long before this revelation was complete the two big doors of the porch had opened in the middle and colonel adams father of the furry young lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6784.mp3	had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside he was a tall sunburnt and very silent man who wore a red smoking cap like a fez making him look like one of the english sirdars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6785.mp3	or pashas in egypt with him was his brother in law lately come from canada a big and rather boisterous young gentleman farmer with a yellow beard by name james blount
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6786.mp3	with him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from the neighbouring roman church for the colonel's late wife had been a catholic and the children as is common in such cases had been trained to follow her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6787.mp3	everything seemed undistinguished about the priest even down to his name which was brown yet the colonel had always found something companionable about him and frequently asked him to such family gatherings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6788.mp3	in the large entrance hall of the house there was ample room even for sir leopold and the removal of his wraps porch and vestibule indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6789.mp3	were unduly large in proportion to the house and formed as it were a big room with the front door at one end and the bottom of the staircase at the other in front of the large hall fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6790.mp3	over which hung the colonel's sword the process was completed and the company including the saturnine crook presented to sir leopold fischer that venerable financier however
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6791.mp3	still seemed struggling with portions of his well lined attire and at length produced from a very interior tail coat pocket a black oval case which he radiantly explained to be his christmas present for his god daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6792.mp3	with an unaffected vain glory that had something disarming about it he held out the case before them all it flew open at a touch and half blinded them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6793.mp3	it was just as if a crystal fountain had spurted in their eyes in a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs three white and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all round them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6794.mp3	fischer stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment and ecstasy of the girl the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the colonel the wonder of the whole group
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6795.mp3	i had to be careful of em coming down they're the three great african diamonds called the flying stars because they've been stolen so often all the big criminals are on the track
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6796.mp3	but even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their hands off them i might have lost them on the road here it was quite possible quite natural i should say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6797.mp3	growled the man in the red tie i shouldn't blame em if they had taken em when they ask for bread and you don't even give them a stone i think they might take the stone for themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6798.mp3	i won't have you talking like that cried the girl who was in a curious glow you've only talked like that since you became a horrid what's his name you know what i mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6799.mp3	a saint said father brown i think said sir leopold with a supercilious smile that ruby means a socialist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6800.mp3	a radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes remarked crook with some impatience and a conservative does not mean a man who preserves jam neither i assure you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6801.mp3	does a socialist mean a man who desires a social evening with the chimney sweep a socialist means a man who wants all the chimneys swept and all the chimney sweeps paid for it but who won't allow you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6802.mp3	put in the priest in a low voice to own your own soot crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect does one want to own soot he asked one might
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6803.mp3	with speculation in his eye i've heard that gardeners use it and i once made six children happy at christmas when the conjuror didn't come entirely with soot applied externally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6804.mp3	oh splendid cried ruby oh i wish you'd do it to this company the boisterous canadian mister blount was lifting his loud voice in applause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6805.mp3	and the astonished financier his in some considerable deprecation when a knock sounded at the double front doors the priest opened them and they showed again the front garden of evergreens monkey tree and all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6806.mp3	now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset the scene thus framed was so coloured and quaint like a back scene in a play that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6807.mp3	he was dusty looking and in a frayed coat evidently a common messenger any of you gentlemen mister blount he asked and held forward a letter doubtfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6808.mp3	mister blount started and stopped in his shout of assent ripping up the envelope with evident astonishment he read it his face clouded a little and then cleared and he turned to his brother in law and host
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6809.mp3	i'm sick at being such a nuisance colonel he said with the cheery colonial conventions but would it upset you if an old acquaintance called on me here tonight on business in point of fact it's florian

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6811.mp3	of course of course replied the colonel carelessly my dear chap any friend of yours no doubt he will prove an acquisition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6812.mp3	he'll black his face if that's what you mean cried blount laughing i don't doubt he'd black everyone else's eyes i don't care i'm not refined
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6813.mp3	i like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat not on mine please said sir leopold fischer with dignity well well observed crook airily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6814.mp3	don't let's quarrel there are lower jokes than sitting on a top hat dislike of the red tied youth born of his predatory opinions and evident intimacy with the pretty godchild
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6815.mp3	led fischer to say in his most sarcastic magisterial manner no doubt you have found something much lower than sitting on a top hat what is it pray

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6817.mp3	what i say is let's do something for the company tonight not blacking faces or sitting on hats if you don't like those but something of the sort why couldn't we have a proper old english pantomime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6818.mp3	clown columbine and so on i saw one when i left england at twelve years old and it's blazed in my brain like a bonfire ever since i came back to the old country only last year

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6820.mp3	or something blue beard's more in my line and him i like best when he turned into the pantaloon i'm all for making a policeman into sausages said john crook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6821.mp3	it's a better definition of socialism than some recently given but surely the get up would be too big a business not a scrap cried blount quite carried away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6822.mp3	a harlequinade's the quickest thing we can do for two reasons first one can gag to any degree and second all the objects are household things

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6833.mp3	but they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry that lives when youth is in a house and youth was in that house that night though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from which it flamed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6834.mp3	as always happens the invention grew wilder and wilder through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had to create the columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6863.mp3	she was as flustered as an old hen with one chicken she put me in charge of the conductor with so many instructions that i know he felt like a newly engaged nursemaid the glee club men rode in the smoking car
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6864.mp3	except jermyn hilliard junior and he followed me right into the parlor car and sat down in the chair exactly opposite patty they cried in shocked chorus you surely didn't speak to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6865.mp3	oh conny murmured disappointedly then what happened priscilla asked nothing at all i got out at coomsdale and uncle tom met me with the automobile the chauffeur took my suit case from the porter and i didn't see it near to at all we reached the house just at tea time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6866.mp3	and i went straight in to tea without going upstairs the butler took up my suit case and the maid came and asked for the key so she could unpack that house is simply running over with servants i'm always scared to death

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6870.mp3	i told you to put it up said priscilla just wait said patty portentously when i went upstairs to dress for dinner the maid met me in the hall with her eyes popping out of her head beg pardon miss patty she said but is that your suit case yes i said of course it's my suit case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6871.mp3	what's the matter with it she just waved her hand toward the table and didn't say a word and there it was wide open patty took a key from her pocket unlocked the suit case and threw back the lid a man's dress suit was neatly folded on the top with a pipe a box of cigarettes some collars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6872.mp3	and various other masculine trifles filling in the interstices oh they gasped in breathless chorus they belong to him conny murmured fervently patty nodded and when i showed uncle tom that suit case he nearly died laughing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6873.mp3	he telephoned to the station but they didn't know anything about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6874.mp3	uncle tom lives five miles from town and there simply wasn't anything we could do that night and just imagine his feelings when he started to dress for the concert and found patty's new pink evening gown spread out on top suggested priscilla oh patty

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6877.mp3	before patty resumed her chronicle and uncle tom made me tell about the suit case at the dinner table everybody laughed it made a very exciting story i told them about the whole school going to the glee club and falling in love in a body with the third man from the end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6878.mp3	and how we all cut his picture out of the program and pasted it in our watches and then about my sitting across from him in the train and changing suit cases mister harper the man next to me said it was the most romantic thing he'd ever heard in his life that louise's marriage was nothing to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6879.mp3	but you didn't leave it i came on the other road i'm going to send it down and what did you wear at the wedding louise's clothes it didn't matter a bit my not matching the other bridesmaids because i was maid of honor and ought to dress differently anyway i've been grown up for three days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6880.mp3	talking to men did you tell the dowager yes i told her about getting the wrong suit case i didn't mention the fact that it belonged to the third man from the end what did she say she said it was very careless of me to run off with a strange man's luggage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6881.mp3	and she hoped he was a gentleman and would take it nicely she telephoned to the baggage man that it was here but she couldn't send martin with it this afternoon because he had to go to the farm for some eggs recreation was over and the girls came trooping in to gather books and pads and pencils for the approaching study hour

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6891.mp3	punctuated by an occasional deep bass laugh when they heard the front door close with one accord they invaded harriet gladden's room which commanded the walk and pressed their noses against the pane a short thick set man of german build was waddling toward the gate and the trolley car
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6892.mp3	they gazed with wide horrified eyes and turned without a word to meet patty as she trudged upstairs lugging her errant suit case a glance told her that they had seen and dropping on the top step she leaned her head against the railing and laughed

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6894.mp3	in the matter of mere pictorial beauty so soon does the soul outgrow its mansions that after once seeing milltown her fancy ran out to the future sight of portland for that having islands and a harbor and two public monuments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6895.mp3	must be far more beautiful than milltown which would she felt take its proud place among the cities of the earth by reason of its tremendous business activity rather than by any irresistible appeal to the imagination

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6901.mp3	now in your last one on solitude you haven't said anything very interesting and you've made it too common and every day to sound well there are too many yous and yours in it you ought to say one now and then to make it seem more like good writing one opens a favorite book
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6902.mp3	one's thoughts are a great comfort in solitude and so on i don't know any more about solitude this week than i did about joy and duty last week grumbled rebecca you tried to be funny about joy and duty said miss dearborn reprovingly so of course you didn't succeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6903.mp3	of recollection joy and duty had been the inspiring subject given to the older children for a theme to be written in five minutes rebecca had wrestled struggled perspired in vain when her turn came to read
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6904.mp3	she was obliged to confess she had written nothing you have at least two lines rebecca insisted the teacher for i see them on your slate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6905.mp3	read what you have good or bad little or much i am excusing nobody rebecca rose overcome with secret laughter dread and mortification then in a low voice she read the couplet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6906.mp3	and the training of the young idea seldom appealed to the sense of humor you must stay after school and try again rebecca she said but she said it smilingly your poetry hasn't a very nice idea in it for a good little girl who ought to love duty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6907.mp3	it wasn't my idea said rebecca apologetically i had only made the first line when i saw you were going to ring the bell and say the time was up i had clash written and i couldn't think of anything then but hash or rash or smash i'll change it to this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6908.mp3	having been instructed in the use of the indefinite pronoun one as giving a refined and elegant touch to literary efforts rebecca painstakingly rewrote her composition on solitude giving it all the benefit of miss dearborn's suggestion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6909.mp3	it then appeared in the following form which hardly satisfied either teacher or pupil solitude it would be false to say that one could ever be alone when one has one's lovely thoughts to comfort one

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6914.mp3	for the next week minnie smellie's mother told miranda sawyer that she'd better look after rebecca for she was given to swearing and profane language that she had been heard saying something dreadful that very afternoon saying it before emma jane and living perkins who only laughed

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6917.mp3	we couldn't keep from laughing after we came out of the tent because they were acting on such a small platform that eliza had to run round and round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6918.mp3	and part of the time she had to pursue the dog i knew living would remember too so i took off my waterproof and wrapped it round my books for a baby
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6919.mp3	just like that the same as eliza did in the play then i leaped from puddle to puddle and living and emma jane pursued me like the bloodhounds it's just like that stupid minnie smellie who doesn't know a game when she sees one and eliza wasn't swearing when she said my god the river
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6920.mp3	it was more like praying well you've got no call to be prayin any more than swearin in the middle of the road said miranda but i'm thankful it's no worse you're born to trouble as the sparks fly upward

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6926.mp3	what under the canopy did they want of a lamp and where did they get the money to pay for it if abner was at home i should think he'd been swappin again said miss miranda the children got it as a prize for selling soap replied rebecca
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6927.mp3	what have you got in the pocket of that new dress that makes it sag down so it's my nuts and raisins from dinner replied rebecca who never succeeded in keeping the most innocent action a secret from her aunt miranda they're just what you gave me on my plate why didn't you eat them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6928.mp3	they were your own rebecca interposed aunt jane and if you chose to save them to give away it is all right we ought never to let this day pass without giving our neighbors something to be thankful for instead of taking all the time to think of our own mercies

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6932.mp3	this time it was a full set of furs for missus ladd and to think we can remember the time he was a barefoot boy without two shirts to his back it is strange he hasn't married with all his money and him so fond of children that he always has a pack of them at his heels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6933.mp3	there's hope for him still though said miss jane smilingly for i don't s'pose he's more than thirty he could get a wife in riverboro if he was a hundred and thirty remarked miss miranda adam's aunt says he was so taken with the little girl that sold the soap clara belle did you say her name was

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6937.mp3	and changed the subject much to jane's gratitude for she had been nervous and ill at ease for the last fifteen minutes what child in riverboro could be described as remarkable and winning save rebecca what child had wonderful eyes except the same rebecca

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6946.mp3	in the wide splash of light that it flung upon the floor sat the simpsons in reverent and solemn silence emma jane standing behind them hand in hand with rebecca there seemed to be no desire for conversation the occasion was too thrilling and serious for that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6947.mp3	the lamp it was tacitly felt by everybody was dignifying the party and providing sufficient entertainment simply by its presence being fully as satisfactory in its way as a pianola or a string band i wish father could see it said clara belle loyally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6948.mp3	murmured susan sagaciously at the appointed hour rebecca dragged herself reluctantly away from the enchanting scene
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6949.mp3	and oh i'm so glad you both live where you can see it shine from our windows i wonder how long it will burn without bein filled if i only keep it lit one hour every night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6950.mp3	mister tubbs brought it over from north riverboro and said somebody sent an order by mail for it rebecca squeezed emma jane's arm and emma jane gave a rapturous return squeeze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6951.mp3	it was mister aladdin whispered rebecca as they ran down the path to the gate seesaw followed them and handsomely offered to see them apiece down the road but rebecca declined his escort with such decision that he did not press the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6952.mp3	but went to bed to dream of her instead in his dreams flashes of lightning proceeded from both her eyes and she held a flaming sword in either hand rebecca entered the home dining room joyously the burnham sisters had gone and the two aunts were knitting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6953.mp3	it was a heavenly party she cried taking off her hat and cape go back and see if you have shut the door tight and then lock it said miss miranda in her usual austere manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6954.mp3	and oh aunt jane aunt miranda if you'll only come into the kitchen and look out of the sink window you can see the banquet lamp shining all red just as if the simpsons house was on fire and probably it will be before long observed miranda i've got no patience with such foolish goin's on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6955.mp3	jane accompanied rebecca into the kitchen although the feeble glimmer which she was able to see from that distance did not seem to her a dazzling exhibition she tried to be as enthusiastic as possible rebecca who was it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6956.mp3	that sold the three hundred cakes of soap to mister ladd in north riverboro mister who exclaimed rebecca mister ladd in north riverboro is that his real name queried rebecca in astonishment i didn't make a bad guess and she laughed softly to herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6957.mp3	i asked you who sold the soap to adam ladd resumed miss jane adam ladd then he's a ladd too what fun answer me rebecca oh excuse me aunt jane i was so busy thinking emma jane and i sold the soap to mister ladd
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6958.mp3	he needed the soap dreadfully as a present for his aunt miss jane still looked a little unconvinced though she only said i hope your aunt miranda won't mind but you know how particular she is rebecca and i really wish you wouldn't do anything out of the ordinary without asking her first for your actions are very queer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6959.mp3	there can't be anything wrong this time rebecca answered confidently emma jane sold her cakes to her own relations and to uncle jerry cobb and i went first to those new tenements near the lumber mill and then to the ladds mister ladd bought all we had and made us promise to keep the secret until the premium came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6960.mp3	rebecca's hair was loosened and falling over her forehead in ruffled waves her eyes were brilliant her cheeks crimson there was a hint of everything in the girl's face of sensitiveness and delicacy as well as of ardor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6961.mp3	there was the sweetness of the mayflower and the strength of the young oak but one could easily divine that she was one of the souls by nature pitched too high by suffering plunged too low
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6962.mp3	providence interferes the battle was carried on very fiercely in mister masters house in dillsborough to the misery of all within it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6963.mp3	the two girls had been intensely anxious for the marriage wishing to have larry for a brother looking forward with delight to their share in the unrestricted plenteousness of chowton farm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6964.mp3	they could quarrel with their elder sister while the assurance was still with them that she would be there to forgive them but now that she was going away and that it had come to be believed by both of them that poor lawrence had no chance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6965.mp3	they were sad and downhearted in all that misery the poor attorney had the worst of it mary was free from her stepmother's zeal and her stepmother's persecution at any rate at night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6966.mp3	but the poor father was hardly allowed to sleep for missus masters never gave up her game as altogether lost though she might be driven alternately into towering passion and prostrate hysterics
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6967.mp3	she would still come again to the battle a word of encouragement would she said bring larry twentyman back to his courtship and that word might be spoken if mary's visit to cheltenham were forbidden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6968.mp3	let mary once be made to understand that she would not be allowed to be a fine lady and then she would marry mister twentyman quick enough but this ushanting this journeying to cheltenham in order that nothing might be done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6969.mp3	was the very way to promote the disease this missus masters said in season and out of season night and day till the poor husband longed for his daughter's departure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6970.mp3	in all these disputes he never quite yielded though his heart sank within him he was still firm he would turn his back to his wife and let her run on with her arguments without a word of answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6971.mp3	but at last there came to her a gleam of hope most unexpectedly it had been settled that mary should make her journey on friday the twelfth february and that reginald morton was again to accompany her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6972.mp3	which was in itself of all things the most pernicious if mary must go to cheltenham why could she not go by herself second class like any other young woman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6973.mp3	nobody would eat her missus masters declared but reginald was firm in his purpose of accompanying her he had no objection whatever to the second class if mister masters preferred it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6974.mp3	then there came a sudden disruption to all these plans and a sudden renewal of her hopes to missus masters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6975.mp3	lady ushant wrote to postpone the visit because she herself had been summoned to bragton her letter to mary though affectionate was very short her grand nephew john the head of the family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6976.mp3	had expressed a desire to see her and with that wish she was bound to comply of course she said she would see mary at bragton or if that were not possible she herself would come into dillsborough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6977.mp3	she did not know what might be the length of her visit but when it was over she hoped that mary would return with her to cheltenham the old lady's letter to reginald was much longer because in that she had to speak of the state of john morton's health
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6978.mp3	and of her surprise that she should be summoned to his bedside of course she would go though she could not look forward with satisfaction to a meeting with the honble missus morton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6979.mp3	then she could not refrain from alluding to the fact that if anything were to happen to john morton reginald himself would be the squire of bragton reginald when he received this at once went over to the attorney's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6980.mp3	but he did not succeed in seeing mary he learned however that they were all aware that the journey had been postponed to missus masters it seemed that all this had been a dispensation of providence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6981.mp3	lady ushant's letter had been received on the thursday and missus masters at once found it expedient to communicate with larry twentyman she was not excellent herself at the writing of letters and therefore she got dolly to be the scribe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6982.mp3	when this was received the poor man was smoking his moody pipe in silence as he roamed about his own farmyard in the darkness of the night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6983.mp3	he had not as yet known any comfort and was still firm in his purpose of selling the farm he had been out hunting once or twice but fancied that people looked at him with peculiar eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6984.mp3	he did not care in the least whether they found or not and when captain glomax was held to have disgraced himself thoroughly by wasting an hour in digging out and then killing a vixen he had not a word to say about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6985.mp3	but as he read dolly's note there came back something of life into his eyes he had forsworn the club but would certainly go when thus invited he wrote a scrawl to dolly i'll come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6986.mp3	and having sent it off by the messenger tried to trust that there might yet be ground for hope missus masters would not have allowed dolly to send such a message without good reason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6987.mp3	john morton might die and then who could tell whether lady ushant would ever return to cheltenham in this way the short lived peace soon came to an end especially as missus masters endeavoured to utilize for general family purposes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6988.mp3	on the saturday larry came to the astonishment of mister masters who was still in his office at half past seven missus masters at once got hold of him and conveyed him away into the sacred drawing room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6989.mp3	mary is not going she said not going to cheltenham it has all been put off she shan't go at all if i can help it but why has it been put off missus masters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6990.mp3	lady ushant is coming to bragton i suppose that poor man is dying he is very ill certainly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6991.mp3	i didn't know she was such friends with the squire as that well there it is lady ushant is coming to bragton and mary is not going to cheltenham
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6992.mp3	this she said as though the news must be of vital importance to larry twentyman he stood for awhile scratching his head as he thought of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6993.mp3	at last it appeared to him that mary's continual residence in dillsborough would of itself hardly assist him i don't see missus masters that that will make her a bit kinder to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6994.mp3	larry don't you be a coward nor yet soft as for coward missus masters i don't know i suppose you really do love the girl i do i think i've shown that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6995.mp3	and you haven't changed your mind not a bit that's why i speak open to you don't you be afraid of her what's the letter which a girl like that writes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6996.mp3	when she gets tantrums into her head of course she'll write a letter but there's somebody else missus masters who says so i say there ain't nobody nobody
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6997.mp3	if anybody tells you that it's only just to put you off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6998.mp3	come to morrow and have a gossip with the girls together and show that you can keep your pluck up that's the way to win her larry did go to the club and did think very much of it as he walked home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/6999.mp3	he had promised to come on the sunday afternoon but he could not bring himself to believe in that theory of books and poetry put forward by missus masters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7000.mp3	on that same wednesday reginald morton had called at the attorney's house had asked for miss masters and had found her alone missus masters at the time had been out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7001.mp3	picking up intelligence about the great case and the two younger girls had been at school reginald as he walked home from bragton all alone on that occasion when larry had returned with mary was quite sure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7002.mp3	that he would never willingly go into mary's presence again why should he disturb his mind about such a girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7003.mp3	but on this wednesday he received a letter and as he told himself merely in consequence of that letter he called at the attorney's house and asked for miss masters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7004.mp3	she wants you to go to her at cheltenham for a month oh mister morton would you like to go how should i not like to go lady ushant is my dearest dearest friend it is so very good of her to think of me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7005.mp3	she talks of the first week in december and wants you to be there for christmas i don't at all know that i can go mister morton why not go i'm afraid mamma will not spare me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7006.mp3	there were many reasons she could hardly go on such a visit without some renewal of her scanty wardrobe which perhaps the family funds would not permit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7007.mp3	and as she knew very well missus masters was not at all favourable to lady ushant if the old lady had altogether kept mary it might have been very well but she had not done so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7008.mp3	and missus masters had more than once said that that kind of thing must be all over meaning that mary was to drop her intimacy with high born people that were of no real use and then there was mister twentyman and his suit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7009.mp3	that her only escape from home would be by becoming missus twentyman i don't think it will be possible mister morton my aunt will be very sorry oh how sorry shall i be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7010.mp3	it is like having another little bit of heaven before me then he said what he certainly should not have said i thought miss masters that your heaven was all here what do you mean by that mister morton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7011.mp3	she asked blushing up to her hair of course she knew what he meant and of course she was angry with him ever since that walk her mind had been troubled by ideas as to what he would think about her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7012.mp3	and now he was telling her what he thought i fancied that you were happy here without going to see an old woman who after all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7013.mp3	i don't want any amusement at any rate you will answer lady ushant of course i shall answer her perhaps you can let me know she wishes me to take you to cheltenham i shall go for a couple of days but i shall not stay longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7014.mp3	if you are going perhaps you would allow me to travel with you of course it would be very kind but i don't suppose that i shall go i am sure lady ushant won't believe that i am kept away from her by any pleasure of my own here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7015.mp3	i can explain it all to her and she will understand me she hardly meant to reproach him she did not mean to assume an intimacy sufficient for reproach but he felt that she had reproached him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7016.mp3	at any rate i will write to lady ushant and will ask papa to let you know then it seemed as though there were nothing else for him but to go and yet he wanted to say some other word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7017.mp3	it does not signify in the least i only want lady ushant to understand that if i could possibly go to her i would rather do that than anything else in the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7018.mp3	because lady ushant is kind to me i needn't expect other people to be so reginald morton was of course the other people then he paused a moment i did so long he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7019.mp3	to walk round the old place with you the other day before these people came there and i was so disappointed when you would not come with me i was coming but you went back with that other man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7020.mp3	of course i did when you showed so plainly that you didn't want him to join you what was i to do i couldn't send him away mister twentyman is a very intimate friend of ours and very kind to dolly and kate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7021.mp3	i wished so much to talk to you about the old days and i wish to go to your aunt mister morton but we can't all of us have what we wish of course i saw that you were very angry but i couldn't help that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7022.mp3	a man may wish to have a little conversation with a very old friend without being interrupted and yet not be grand i dare say mister twentyman is just as good as i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7023.mp3	i believe him to be a great deal better for he earns his bread and takes care of his mother and as far as i know does his duty thoroughly i know the difference mister morton and of course i know how you feel it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7024.mp3	he had come there ardently wishing that she might be allowed to go to his aunt and resolved that he would take her himself if it were possible but now he almost thought that she had better not go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7025.mp3	if she had made her election she must be allowed to abide by it if she meant to marry mister twentyman what good could she get by associating with his aunt or with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7026.mp3	he was of course altogether unconscious what grand things his cousin john had intended to do by him had not the honourable old lady interfered but he had made up his mind that duty required him to call at the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7027.mp3	so he walked by the path across the bridge and when he came out on the gravel road near the front door he found a gentleman smoking a cigar and looking around him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7028.mp3	the circumstances of which must be narrated in the next chapter the senator lifted his hat and remarked that it was a very fine afternoon reginald lifted his hat and assented
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7029.mp3	mister morton sir i think is out with the ladies taking a drive i will leave a card then the old lady is at home sir if you wish to see her continued the senator following reginald up to the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7030.mp3	you live in these parts sir asked the senator in the town yonder because mister morton's housekeeper seems to know you she knows me very well as i was brought up in this house good morning to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7031.mp3	good afternoon to you sir perhaps you can tell me who lives in that country residence what you call a farm house on the other side of the road reginald said that he presumed the gentleman was alluding to mister twentyman's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7032.mp3	ah yes i dare say that was the name i heard up there you are not mister twentyman sir my name is morton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7033.mp3	ah yes he didn't like to say uncle because reginald didn't look old enough and he knew he ought not to say brother because the elder brother in england would certainly have had the property i am mister john morton's cousin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7034.mp3	i asked whether you were the owner of that farm house because i intruded just now by passing through the yards and i would have apologized good afternoon to you sir then reginald having thus done his duty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7035.mp3	returned home mary masters when she was alone was again very angry with herself she knew thoroughly how perverse she had been when she declared that larry twentyman was a fit companion for herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7036.mp3	and that she had said it on purpose to punish the man who was talking to her not a day passed or hardly an hour of a day in which she did not tell herself that the education she had received and the early associations of her life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7037.mp3	chapter seven the inquest the coroner who fully realized that for that one day of his life as a provincial solicitor he was living in the gaze of the world had resolved to be worthy of the fleeting eminence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7038.mp3	he was a large man of jovial temper with a strong interest in the dramatic aspects of his work and the news of manderson's mysterious death within his jurisdiction had made him the happiest coroner in england
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7039.mp3	the court was held in a long unfurnished room lately built onto the hotel and intended to serve as a ball room or concert hall a regiment of reporters was entrenched in the front seats
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7040.mp3	and those who were to be called on to give evidence occupied chairs to one side of the table behind which the coroner sat while the jury in double row with plastered hair and a spurious ease of manner flanked him on the other side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7041.mp3	an undistinguished public filled the rest of the space and listened in an awed silence to the opening solemnities the newspaper men well used to these
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7042.mp3	the identity of the dead man was proved by his wife the first witness called from whom the coroner after some inquiry into the health and circumstances of the deceased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7043.mp3	proceeded to draw an account of the last occasion on which she had seen her husband alive missus manderson was taken through her evidence by the coroner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7044.mp3	with the sympathy which every man felt for that dark figure of grief she lifted her thick veil before beginning to speak and the extreme paleness and unbroken composure of the lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7045.mp3	produced a singular impression this was not an impression of hardness interesting femininity was the first thing to be felt in her presence she was not even enigmatic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7046.mp3	but her voice was low and clear to the end her husband she said had come up to his bedroom about his usual hour for retiring on the sunday night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7047.mp3	his room was really a dressing room attached to her own bedroom communicating with it by a door which was usually kept open during the night both dressing room and bedroom were entered by other doors giving on the passage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7048.mp3	and liked to sleep in a small room she had not been awake when he came up but had been half aroused as usually happened when the light was switched on in her husband's room she had spoken to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7049.mp3	she had no clear recollection of what she had said as she had been very drowsy at the time but she had remembered that he had been out for a moonlight run in the car
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7050.mp3	and what time it was she had asked what the time was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7051.mp3	he did explain why i remember very well what he said because she stopped with a little appearance of confusion because the coroner insisted gently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7052.mp3	he said that mister marlowe could do it quite easily if he had no accident he said that he had started in the car and then walked back home a mile or so and felt all the better for it did he say any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7053.mp3	and you heard nothing in the night no i never woke until my maid brought my tea in the morning at seven o'clock she closed the door leading to my husband's room as she always did

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7227.mp3	of amabel smoothing out the folds of her crisp white frock with an incredulous almost insulting smile that at once fixed attention again on frederick he seized the occasion and spoke up in a tone of great resolve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7228.mp3	i have made an assertion said he before god and before this jury to make it seem a credible one i shall have to tell my own story from the beginning am i allowed to do so mister coroner you are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7229.mp3	was the firm response then gentlemen continued frederick still without looking at amabel whose smile had acquired a mockery that drew the eyes of the jury toward her more than once during the following recital
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7230.mp3	you know and the public generally now know that missus webb has left me the greater portion of the money of which she died possessed i have never before acknowledged to anyone not even to the good man who awaits this jury's verdict
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7231.mp3	on the other side of that door yonder that she had reasons for this good reasons reasons of which up to the very evening of her death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7232.mp3	or that i was the special object of her attention or that we were under any mutual obligations in any way why then i should have thought of going to her in the great strait in which i found myself on that day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7233.mp3	i cannot say i knew she had money in her house this i had unhappily been made acquainted with in an accidental way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7234.mp3	and quite capable of doing a very unselfish act still this would not seem to be reason enough for me to intrude upon her late at night with a plea for a large loan of money had i not been in a desperate condition of mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7235.mp3	which made any attempt seem reasonable that promised relief from the unendurable burden of a pressing and disreputable debt i was obliged to have money a great deal of money and i had to have it at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7236.mp3	as i had been told early in the evening a small entertainment was being given which would insure its being open even at so late an hour as midnight miss page who will i am sure pardon the introduction of her name into this narrative
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7237.mp3	has taken pains to declare to you that in the expedition she herself made into town that evening she followed some person's steps down hill this is very likely true and those steps were probably mine for after leaving the house by the garden door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7238.mp3	and so hastened on till i came to the gate on high street here i had a moment of hesitation and thoughts bitter enough for me to recall them at this moment came into my mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7239.mp3	but they passed thank god and with no more desperate feeling than a sullen intention of having my own way about this money i lifted the latch of the front door and stepped in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7240.mp3	or at least to hear the sound of merry voices and laughter in the rooms above but no sounds of any sort awaited me indeed the house seemed strangely silent for one so fully lighted and astonished at this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7241.mp3	i pushed the door ajar at my left and looked in an unexpected and pitiful sight awaited me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7242.mp3	i saw the master of the house with his head sunk forward on his arms asleep the expected guests had failed to arrive and he tired out with waiting had fallen into a doze at the board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7243.mp3	this was a condition of things for which i was not prepared missus webb whom i wished to see was probably up stairs and while i might summon her by a sturdy rap on the door beside which i stood i had so little desire to wake her husband
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7244.mp3	of whose mental condition i was well aware that i could not bring myself to make any loud noise within his hearing yet i had not the courage to retreat all my hope of relief from the many difficulties that menaced me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7245.mp3	lay in the generosity of this great hearted woman and if out of pusillanimity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7246.mp3	nothing but shame and disaster awaited me yet how could i hope to lure her down stairs without noise i could not and so yielding to the impulse of the moment without any realisation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7247.mp3	i slipped up the narrow staircase
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7248.mp3	for she rose and meeting my eye with a gaze in which shock and some strange and poignant agony totally incomprehensible to me were strangely blended she cried out no no frederick you don't know what you are doing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7249.mp3	if you want my money take it if you want my life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7250.mp3	don't stain yours don't i did not understand her i did not know until i thought it over afterward that my hand was thrust convulsively into my breast in a way which taken with my wild mien

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7253.mp3	more than the outward seeming of her life can hardly measure plunged against it and i can tell you no more her blood and batsy's shriek from the adjoining room swam through my consciousness and then she fell as i supposed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7254.mp3	and i in scarcely better case fell also this as god lives is the truth concerning the wound found in the breast of this never to be forgotten woman the feeling the pathos the anguish even to be found in his tone made this story

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7256.mp3	what i must now explain is how the money in missus webb's drawer came into my possession and how the dagger she had planted in her breast came to be found on the lawn outside when i came to myself and that must have been very soon i found
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7257.mp3	that the blow of which i had been such a horrified witness had not yet proved fatal the eyes i had seen close as i had supposed forever were now open and she was looking at me with a smile that has never left my memory and never will

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7260.mp3	do these words this action of hers seem incredible to you sirs alas alas they will not when i tell you and here he cast one anxious deeply anxious glance at the room in which mister sutherland was hidden

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7276.mp3	and though her strength and breath were fast failing her she made me understand that she was worried about the zabels who had not come according to a sacred custom between them to celebrate the anniversary of her wedding

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7288.mp3	but as i hastened on toward the quarter where the zabels lived i was seized by such compunction for his desolate state that i faltered in my rapid flight and did not arrive at the place of my destination as quickly as i intended when i did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7289.mp3	but i did not turn away remembering my mother's anxiety an anxiety so extreme it disturbed her final moments i approached the front door and was about to knock when i found it open greatly astonished i at once passed in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7290.mp3	and seeing my way perfectly in the moonlight entered the room on the left the door of which also stood open it was the second house i had entered unannounced that night and in this as in the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7291.mp3	i encountered a man sitting asleep by the table it was john the elder of the two and perceiving that he was suffering for food and in a condition of extreme misery i took out the first bill my hand encountered

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7293.mp3	i hastened away and took the shortest path home had i been more of a man or if my visit to missus webb had been actuated by a more communicable motive i would have gone at once to the good man who believed me to be of his own flesh and blood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7294.mp3	and told him of the strange and heart rending adventure which had changed the whole tenor of my thoughts and life

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7300.mp3	frederick himself felt the change and showed it by the look of relief and growing confidence he cast at agnes of the questions and answers which now passed between him and the various members of the jury i need give no account

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7317.mp3	our steamer was the good ship saint paul belonging to the alaska commercial company and was advertised to sail on may twenty fifth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7318.mp3	when i laughingly called the attention of one of the owners of the ship to the fact that that date fell upon friday and many persons objected to sailing upon that day he postponed the starting of the saint paul to may twenty sixth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7319.mp3	and we left the dock on saturday afternoon amid the cheers and hand waving of thousands of people who had come to see the big boat off for nome the steamer was well fitted out spick and span in fresh carpets and paint
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7320.mp3	and crowded to the utmost capacity for comfort every stateroom was full each seat at the tables occupied not a foot of space above or below decks was left unused but provision was made for all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7321.mp3	and the ship was well manned i was now much gratified to learn that there were many on board whom i had met before that the steward stewardess and several of the waiters had been on duty on the steamer bertha
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7322.mp3	during my trip out from alaska the fall before while i was upon speaking terms with a dozen or more of the passengers with whom i had traveled from the same place of passengers we had all told

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7324.mp3	whom i had seen at saint michael some months before and who was now going back to her northern home she wore a sailor suit of navy blue serge trimmed with white braid and was as coy and cunning as ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7325.mp3	not speaking often to strangers but laughing and running away to her mother when addressed from the day we sailed from san francisco until we reached nome i missed no meals in the dining salon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7326.mp3	a pace which my english friends and others could not follow for they were uncomfortably ill in the region of their digestive apparatus for several days i slept for hours each day and thoroughly enjoyed the trip
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7327.mp3	during the nine days sail from san francisco to unalaska a distance of two thousand three hundred and sixty eight miles i studied well the passengers we had preachers on board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7328.mp3	as well as doctors lawyers merchants and miners and there were women going to nome to start eating houses hotels and mercantile shops there were several swedish missionaries
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7329.mp3	one a zealous young woman from san francisco going to the swedish mission at golovin bay this young person was pretty and pleasant and i was glad to make her acquaintance as well as that of three other women speaking the same tongue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7330.mp3	and occupying the next stateroom to mine the last named were going to start a restaurant in nome as they were sociable jolly and good sailors for the most part i enjoyed their society they had all lived in san francisco for years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7331.mp3	and though not related to each other were firm friends of long standing and were uniting their little fortunes in the hope of making greater ones the young missionary was a friend to the other three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7332.mp3	and i found no better or more congenial companions on board the ship than these four honest hard working women so full of hope courage and good sense as well as christianity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7333.mp3	little did i then think that these people placed by a seeming chance in an adjoining stateroom were to be my fellow workers and true friends not only for the coming months in that arctic land to which we were going but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7334.mp3	as the sequel will show perhaps for years to come not many days had passed when we found that we had on board what few steamers can boast of and that was an orchestra of professional musicians among the waiters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7335.mp3	these were men going with all the others to seek their fortunes in the new gold fields working their passage as waiters on the ship to nome where they intended to leave it three evenings in the week these musicians
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7336.mp3	with the help of several singers on board gave concerts in the dining salon which though impromptu were very enjoyable a sweet and trained singer was the english girl of our company
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7337.mp3	and she sang many times accompanied by the stringed instruments of the musicians much to the delight of the assembled passengers when she sang one evening in her clear sympathetic voice the selection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7338.mp3	oh where is my wandering boy tonight there was not a dry eye in the room and the mind of many a man went back to his old home and praying mother in some far distant state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7339.mp3	making him resolve to write oftener to her that she might be comforted with a knowledge of his whereabouts and welfare these evenings were sometimes varied by recitations from an elocutionist on board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7340.mp3	and a practised clog dancer excited the risibles of the company to the extent that they usually shouted with laughter at his exhibition of flying heels day after day passed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7341.mp3	those who were continually seasick had diversion enough it was useless for us to tell them a pathetic tale of some one who at some time had been more ill than they because they would not believe a word of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7342.mp3	and it was equally useless to recommend an antidote for mal de mer such as theirs no one was ever so ill before they said they knew they should die and be buried at sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7343.mp3	and hoped they would if that would put an end to their sufferings we tried at last to give them comfort by recommending out of former experiences ship's biscuit dry toast and pop corn as remedies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7344.mp3	but only received black looks as our reward we then concluded that a diet of tea coffee and soup was exactly such a one as the fishes would recommend could they speak

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7346.mp3	but they were all tree physical as well as free moral agents and decided these things for themselves at last we entered the japan current and the weather was warmer and more enjoyable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7347.mp3	on monday june fourth we saw from the deck a few drifting logs and a quantity of seaweed and these with the presence of gulls and goonies flying overhead convinced us that we were nearing land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7348.mp3	we were not mistaken after eating an excellent six o'clock dinner we went above to find ourselves between high rocky cliffs which loomed up into mountains not far distant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7349.mp3	and we knew we were again at the aleutian islands and in the rough waters of unimak pass as we drew nearer and entered the harbor so well land locked the sun dipped low into yellow red western waters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7350.mp3	thereby casting long shadows aslant our pathway so delicately shaded in greens the little hamlet of dutch harbor nestled cosily at the foot of the mountains which bordered the bay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7351.mp3	and here numbers of ships lay anchored at rest passing along easily beyond another high mountain we were soon at the dock of unalaska beside other great ships in port
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7352.mp3	both groups of craft were evidently waiting for the ice to clear from behring sea before proceeding on their way northward and we counted sixteen ships of different kinds and sizes the majority of them large steamers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7353.mp3	all were loaded with passengers and freight for nome scout boats had already been sent out to investigate and find if possible a passage through the ice fields
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7354.mp3	and the return of these scouts with good news was anxiously watched and waited for as the most desired thing at that time was a speedy and safe landing on the supposedly golden beach sands of nome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7355.mp3	at unalaska we spent four days taking on fresh water and coal during which time passengers visited back and forth from the waiting steamers many persons having friends on other boats
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7356.mp3	and each having a curiosity to see if they were faring as well or ill as he comparing notes as to the expense of traveling with the different companies et cetera passengers on the saint paul agreed that they had no kick comin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7357.mp3	which was one of the commonest slang phrases intended to mean that they had no fault to find with the alaska commercial company and their steamer saint paul all were well cared for and satisfied as well they might be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7358.mp3	with the service of the ship's men leaving unalaska the sun shone clear and cold upon the mountains where in places the sides looked black from the late fires started in the deep tundra by miscreants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7359.mp3	the tops of the mountains were covered with snow down deep gorges dashed mountain waters of melting snow and ice hurrying to leap off gullied and rocky cliffs into the sea their progress was never impeded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7360.mp3	no tree nor shrub obstructed the way with gnarled old trunks twisted roots or low hanging branches for none grow in unalaska
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7361.mp3	and the bold dignity and grandeur of the mountains is never diminished by these lesser objects as our ship sailed out into behring sea we were closely followed by the steamer george w elder whose master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7362.mp3	an old friend of our captain had decided to follow in our wake he being less familiar than the latter with alaskan waters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7363.mp3	on the morning of the twenty sixth of june i awoke to find that the ice had drifted out to sea in the night eight days after mollie and i had taken our twelve miles trip across the bay and return
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7364.mp3	then came hard rain and wind that for several days blew the ice back into the bay first to one side and then to the other so that the steamers waiting to come in could not do so for fear of the drifting floes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7365.mp3	by the thirtieth of june schooners were coming into the bay with passengers and freight and the coast steamers elmore and dora had begun to make regular trips to and from nome with them came mails from the outside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7366.mp3	with newspapers and tidings of friends in the states then our fingers trembled at opening our letters until we found that all our dear ones were well and we heartily thanked the lord

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7371.mp3	they came from the east west north and south all sorry to know of her illness and bringing presents with them sometimes it was a little live bird or squirrel a delicious salmon trout
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7372.mp3	or wild fowl for her supper sometimes it was candy nuts or fresh fruit from nome and with everything she was well pleased and joyous friends soon came in from the outside bringing city dolls dressed in ribbons and laces
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7373.mp3	there were tiny dishes chairs tables a hundred things dear to a little girl's heart and all pleased her immensely but all were laid quickly aside for a basket of wild flowers or mosses

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7380.mp3	nothing so delicious as their salads for the french cooks had long ago gone the hotel management being changed and mollie had a nice little kitchen of her own and with fresh salmon trout wild fowl

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7401.mp3	one or more of these beats being stronger than the rest two certain rhythmic figures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7402.mp3	cetera which form the actual musical content of these groups the student will note the essential difference between rhythm and measure rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a series of beats or pulses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7403.mp3	while measure is the grouping of these beats according to some specified system in listening to a piece of music two hearers a and b may feel the rhythm equally strongly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7404.mp3	but a may subjectively group the beats into one two one two et cetera while b feels the groups as one two three four one two three four et cetera
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7405.mp3	rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing inherent in the music itself while measure is to a certain extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have adopted for practical purposes ninety eight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7406.mp3	in syncopation the normal system of accenting is temporarily suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part of the measure syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary interruption of a normal series of accents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7407.mp3	and compound a simple measure is one which has but a single accent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7408.mp3	two beat measure and three beat measure a compound measure is as its name implies one made up by combining two or more simple measures or by the elaboration of a single measure in slow tempo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7409.mp3	into several constituent groups the principal compound measures are four beat and six beat both being referred to as compound duple measures five beat seven beat nine beat and twelve beat measures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7410.mp3	are also classified as compound measures an english writer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7411.mp3	classifies measures as duple triple or quadruple specifying that a simple measure is one in which each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided into halves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7412.mp3	and that a compound measure is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted note whose value can be divided into three parts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7413.mp3	there is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words simple and compound when applied in this connection the principal question at issue being whether four beat measure is an individual variety
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7414.mp3	or whether it is a variety compounded out of two beat measures either by placing two of these in a group or by the elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats as is often necessary in slow tempi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7415.mp3	perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7416.mp3	in which there are three beats the first one being accented the second and third unaccented
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7417.mp3	three eighth three quarter and three half measure respectively three quadruple in which there are four beats the first and third being accented primary accent on one secondary accent on three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7418.mp3	the second and fourth unaccented
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7419.mp3	four sextuple in which there are six beats the first and fourth being accented the others not in rapid tempi this is always taken as compound duple measure a dotted quarter note having a beat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7420.mp3	it will be noted that the two measures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7421.mp3	but these are practically always taken as three beat and four beat measures respectively being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is thought of as a triplet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7422.mp3	quintuple five beat and septuple seven beat measures are occasionally met with but these are rare and will always be sporadic the five beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7423.mp3	or of two and three sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition while the seven beat measure is taken in groups of four and three or of three and four
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7424.mp3	but usage varies somewhat and the second sign is sometimes used to indicate four half measure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7425.mp3	but an incomplete circle differentiating two beat imperfect measure from three beat perfect measure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7426.mp3	chapter twenty seven but we must follow edward for a time on his arrival at paris he was kindly received by king charles who promised to assist his views in joining the army

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7429.mp3	and he will soon be opposed to this truculent and dishonest court who have kept me here as an instrument to accomplish their own wishes but who have never intended to keep their promises and place me on the english throne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7430.mp3	i will give you letters to conde and recollect that whatever general you take service under you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong that is not your affair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7431.mp3	conde is just now released from vincennes but depend upon it he will be in arms very soon as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king edward presented himself at the levee of the prince of conde

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7436.mp3	said the prince in securing the services of such fine young men you will oblige me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service and then follow me to guienne to which province i am now about to depart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7437.mp3	and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required a month after this interview conde who had been joined by a great number of nobles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7438.mp3	and had been re enforced by troops from spain set up the standard of revolt edward and his friends joined them with about three hundred english and scotchmen which they had enlisted and very soon afterward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7439.mp3	conde obtained the victory at blenan and in april sixteen fifty two advanced to paris turenne who had taken the command of the french army followed him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7440.mp3	and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of saint antoine in which neither party had the advantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7441.mp3	and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards he fell back to the frontiers of champagne previous to his departure from paris edward had received humphrey's letter explaining away the intendant's conduct
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7442.mp3	and the contents removed a heavy load from edward's mind but he now thought of nothing but war and although he cherished the idea of patience heatherstone he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7443.mp3	he wrote a letter to the intendant thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again he did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7444.mp3	except in inquiring after her health and sending his respects it may be years before i see her again thought edward and who knows what may happen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7445.mp3	and edward with his friends followed his fortunes and gained his good will they were rapidly promoted time flew on and in the year sixteen fifty four the court of france concluded an alliance with cromwell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7446.mp3	and expelled king charles from the french frontiers the war was still carried on in the netherlands turenne bore down conde who had gained every campaign and the court of spain wearied with reverses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7447.mp3	made overtures of peace which was gladly accepted by the french during these wars cromwell had been named protector and had shortly afterward died
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7448.mp3	edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7449.mp3	after the peace and the pardon of conde by the french king the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7450.mp3	and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and every thing was ready for the restoration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7451.mp3	on the fifteenth of may sixteen sixty the news arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the eighth and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over the king sailed from scheveling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7452.mp3	was met at dover by general monk and conducted to london which he entered amid the acclamations of the people on the twenty ninth of the same month we may leave the reader to suppose that edward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7453.mp3	were among the most favored of those in his train as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude the windows of all the houses were filled with well dressed ladies who waved their white kerchiefs to the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7454.mp3	and his attendant suit chaloner edward and grenville who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting were certainly the most distinguished among the king's retinue look edward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7455.mp3	at those lovely girls at yon window do you recognize them indeed i do not are they any of our paris beauties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7456.mp3	they are thy sisters alice and edith
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7457.mp3	it is so i believe replied edward yes now that edith smiles i'm sure it is them yes replied grenville
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7458.mp3	will they think you recognize us we shall see replied edward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7459.mp3	for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7460.mp3	well chaloner to all appearance your good aunts have done justice to their charge nature has done more edward i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7461.mp3	although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice that's edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7462.mp3	alice and edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7463.mp3	the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverley said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7464.mp3	and they could escape from their personal attentions edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conynghame and his sisters we pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7465.mp3	which it gave to edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women that his two friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7466.mp3	now edward who do you think was here to day the reigning belle and the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7467.mp3	no less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted edward patience heatherstone patience heatherstone cried edward the toast of all london yes and deservedly so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7468.mp3	i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7469.mp3	with her to day when did you hear from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now altogether indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7470.mp3	and i understand is a very princely mansion humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong it belongs to mister heatherstone does it not replied edward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7471.mp3	how can you say so edward you received humphrey's letters a long while ago yes i did but let us not talk about it any more my dear edith i am in great perplexity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7472.mp3	what is your perplexity well replied edward since it is to be so let us sit down and talk over the matter i acknowledge the kindness of mister heatherstone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7473.mp3	and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7474.mp3	but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i am for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7475.mp3	although not said it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer and i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in one lot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7476.mp3	you will not accept them they must be divided and handed over to you in two said alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you can not blame accepting the property from mister heatherstone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7477.mp3	is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter now why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7478.mp3	he can not refuse it put not your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king or his council will consider it advisable to make so many discontented
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7479.mp3	which has been so long held by others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7480.mp3	recollect also that mister heatherstone and his brother in law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7481.mp3	and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you besides merely for what may be called a point of honor for it is no more in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7482.mp3	at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mister heatherstone wait and see what he proffers first but my dear sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7483.mp3	why has he rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7484.mp3	you were at the wars it was possible that you might or might not return he said this to humphrey who has all along been acting as his factotum in the business and recollect at the time that mister heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7485.mp3	what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mister heatherstone's intentions than he has made known to us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7486.mp3	and i therefore say again my dear edward make no application till you ascertain what mister heatherstone's intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it replied edward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7487.mp3	and now let me give you some advice for your friends masters chaloner and grenville that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7488.mp3	those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7489.mp3	but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the king's intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7490.mp3	even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys impress that upon them my dear edward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7491.mp3	and make the arrangements that is advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we may as well here inform the reader
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7492.mp3	that the advice was immediately acted upon and that chaloner and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had dispatched a messenger with the letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7493.mp3	but the messenger had not yet returned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7494.mp3	on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edward's sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7495.mp3	and waiting for the arrival of his sisters chaloner and grenville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7496.mp3	mister heatherstone who led his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7497.mp3	edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7498.mp3	but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7499.mp3	there was the same pensive sweet expression in her face which had altered little but the beautiful rounded arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7500.mp3	and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day mister heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7501.mp3	and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her the king said loud enough for edward to hear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7502.mp3	i trust that the daughter will often grace our court patience made no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7503.mp3	and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers the sight of her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over and he was enabled to go to his sisters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7504.mp3	when he entered the room he found himself in the arms of humphrey who had arrived with the messenger after the greetings were over edward said alice and i have seen patience and i fear i must surrender at discretion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7505.mp3	mister heatherstone may make his own terms i must wave all pride rather than lose her i thought that i had more control over myself but i have seen her and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7506.mp3	let her father but give me her and arnwood will be but a trifle in addition with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood said humphrey i can inform you what they are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7507.mp3	they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mister heatherstone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7508.mp3	has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property he has indeed replied edward as for his daughter edward you have yet to win her and wear her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7509.mp3	as the saying is her father will resign the property to you as yours by right but you have no property in his daughter and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7510.mp3	but why should you say so humphrey have we not been attached from our youth yes it was a youthful passion i grant but recollect nothing came of it and years have passed away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7511.mp3	it is now seven years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mister heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7512.mp3	and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of seventeen to twenty four will cherish the image of one who to say the least had treated her with indifference that is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7513.mp3	and it may be true replied edward mournfully well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7514.mp3	you know humphrey how many offers patience heatherstone has had and has every day i may say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7515.mp3	to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argued upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7516.mp3	replied edith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7517.mp3	after that speech sir the sooner you get back again the better retorted edith but edward made a sign to humphrey and they beat a retreat have you seen the intendant humphrey no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7518.mp3	i was about to call upon him but i wanted to see you first i will go with you i have not done him justice replied edward and yet i hardly know how to explain to him say nothing but meet him cordially
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7519.mp3	that will be explanation sufficient i shall meet him as one whom i shall always revere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7520.mp3	what must he think of my not having called upon him nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him your coming with me will make it appear so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7521.mp3	tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct you are right i will i fear however humphrey that you are right and edith wrong as regards his daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7522.mp3	nay edward recollect that i have as edith observed passed my life in the woods edward was most kindly received by mister heatherstone edward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7523.mp3	on mister heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct simply adding you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7524.mp3	patience colored up and trembled when edward first saw her edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance he wooed her again and won her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7525.mp3	then all was explained about a year after the restoration there was a fete at hampton court given in honor of three marriages taking place edward beverley to patience heatherstone chaloner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7526.mp3	to alice and grenville to edith and as his majesty himself said as he gave away the brides could loyalty be better rewarded but our young readers will not be content if they do not hear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7527.mp3	some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history humphrey must take the first place his love of farming continued edward gave him a large farm rent free
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7528.mp3	and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself he then married clara ratcliffe who has not appeared lately on the scene owing to her having been about two years before the restoration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7529.mp3	claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7530.mp3	the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo who became a very steady character and in the course of time married a young girl from arnwood and had a houseful of young gipsies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7531.mp3	oswald so soon as edward came down to arnwood gave up his place in the new forest and lived entirely with edward as his steward and phoebe also went to arnwood and lived to a good old age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7532.mp3	in the capacity of housekeeper her temper becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7533.mp3	chapter twelve morning calls well i suppose we must friends in council
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7534.mp3	mister thornton had had some difficulty in working up his mother to the desired point of civility she did not often make calls and when she did it was in heavy state that she went through her duties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7535.mp3	but she refused to let him keep horses for it they were hired for the solemn occasions when she paid morning or evening visits she had had horses for three days not a fortnight before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7536.mp3	who might now put themselves to trouble and expense in their turn yet crampton was too far off for her to walk and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to whether his wish that she should call on the hales was strong enough to bear the expense of cab hire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7537.mp3	the last time you were out in a cab you came home with a headache from the jolting i never complained of it i'm sure no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7538.mp3	but so much the more i have to watch over you now as for fanny there a little hardship would do her good she is not made of the same stuff as you are john she could not bear it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7539.mp3	missus thornton was silent after this for her last words bore relation to a subject which mortified her she had an unconscious contempt for a weak character and fanny was weak in the very points in which her mother and brother were strong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7540.mp3	missus thornton was not a woman much given to reasoning her quick judgment and firm resolution served her in good stead of any long arguments and discussions with herself she felt instinctively that nothing could strengthen fanny to endure hardships patiently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7541.mp3	which the uneasy tenderness of missus thornton's manner to her daughter the shame with which she thought to hide the poverty of her child in all the grand qualities which she herself possessed unconsciously and which she set so high a value upon in others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7542.mp3	this shame i say betrayed the want of a secure resting place for her affection she never called her son by any name but john love and dear and such like terms were reserved for fanny
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7543.mp3	but her heart gave thanks for him day and night and she walked proudly among women for his sake fanny dear i shall have horses to the carriage to day to go and call on these hales
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7544.mp3	with what asked missus thornton her brow slightly contracting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7545.mp3	missus thornton did not speak but she laid her work on the table and seemed to think it will be a long way for her to walk back at night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7546.mp3	at this point mister thornton came in just before going to the mill mother i need hardly say that if there is any little thing that could serve missus hale as an invalid you will offer it i'm sure if i can find it out i will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7547.mp3	it will do you good instead of harm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7548.mp3	he went abruptly out of the room after saying this if he had staid a minute longer fanny would have cried at his tone of command even when he used the words you will oblige me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7549.mp3	fanny don't speak so of your brother he has good reasons of some kind or other or he would not wish us to go make haste and put your things on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7550.mp3	but the little altercation between her son and her daughter did not incline missus thornton more favourably towards these hales her jealous heart repeated her daughter's question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7551.mp3	missus thornton was shy it was only of late years that she had had leisure enough in her life to go into society and as society she did not enjoy it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7552.mp3	as dinner giving and as criticising other people's dinners she took satisfaction in it but this going to make acquaintance with strangers was a very different thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7553.mp3	as missus thornton observed to herself she liked missus hale's double knitting far better that was sensible of its kind the room altogether was full of knick knacks which must take a long time to dust and time to people of limited income was money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7554.mp3	missus hale was making rather more exertion in her answers captivated by some real old lace which missus thornton wore lace as she afterwards observed to dixon of that old english point which has not been made for this seventy years and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7555.mp3	which cannot be bought it must have been an heir loom and shows that she had ancestors so the owner of the ancestral lace became worthy of something more than the languid exertion to be agreeable to a visitor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7556.mp3	fifteen shillings a week and three saved out of them thought margaret to herself but she must have been very young she probably has forgotten her own personal experience but she must know of those days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7557.mp3	margaret's manner had an extra tinge of coldness in it when she next spoke you have good concerts here i believe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7558.mp3	too crowded that is the worst
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7559.mp3	but surely it is a very easy journey to london yes but somehow said fanny lowering her voice mamma has never been to london herself and can't understand my longing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7560.mp3	may i inquire margaret had not the words ready for an answer to this question which took her a little by surprise so miss thornton replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7561.mp3	as fanny had put it it did seem as if they had been impertinently discussing missus thornton's feelings but she also rose up against that lady's manner of showing that she was offended missus thornton went on after a moment's pause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7562.mp3	do you know anything of milton miss hale have you seen any of our factories our magnificent warehouses no said margaret i have not seen anything of that description as yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7563.mp3	then she felt that by concealing her utter indifference to all such places she was hardly speaking with truth so she went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7564.mp3	every improvement of machinery is i believe to be seen there in its highest perfection i am so glad you don't like mills and manufactories and all those kind of things said fanny in a half whisper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7565.mp3	she will do you no good i see the mother looks very ill and seems a nice quiet kind of person
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7566.mp3	this book owes its origin to the fact that in the autumn of nineteen twenty one the authorities of manchester college oxford invited me to deliver the inaugural course of a lectureship in religion newly established under the will of the late professor upton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7567.mp3	no conditions being attached to this appointment it seemed a suitable opportunity to discuss so far as possible in the language of the moment some of the implicits which i believe to underlie human effort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7568.mp3	and achievement in the domain of the spiritual life the material gathered for this purpose has now been added to revised and to some extent re written
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7569.mp3	or who are offended by the resulting demonstrations of continuity between our most homely and most lofty reactions to the universe might take to themselves the plain words of thomas a kempis thou art a man and not god thou art flesh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7570.mp3	and no angel since my subject is not the splendor of historic sanctity but the normal life of the spirit as it may be and is lived in the here and now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7571.mp3	no attention has been given to those abnormal experiences and states of consciousness which too often regarded as specially mystical are now recognized by all competent students as representing the unfortunate accidents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7572.mp3	rather than the abiding substance of spirituality readers of these pages will find nothing about trances ecstasies and other rare psychic phenomena which sometimes indicate holiness and sometimes only disease
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7573.mp3	for information on these matters they must go to larger and more technical works my aim here is the more general one of indicating first the characteristic experiences discoverable within all great religions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7574.mp3	which justify or are fundamental to the spiritual life and the way in which these experiences may be accommodated to the world view of the modern man and next the nature of that spiritual life as it appears in human history
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7575.mp3	the succeeding sections of the book treat in some detail the light cast on spiritual problems by mental analysis a process which need not necessarily be conducted from the standpoint of a degraded materialism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7576.mp3	and by recent work on the psychology of autistic thought and of suggestion these investigations have a practical interest for every man who desires to be the captain of his soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7577.mp3	the relation in which institutional religion does or should stand to the spiritual life is also in part a matter for psychology which is here called upon to deal with the religious aspect of the social instincts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7578.mp3	and the problems surrounding symbols and cults these chapters lead up to a discussion of the personal aspect of the spiritual life its curve of growth characters and activities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7579.mp3	and a further section suggests some ways in which educationists might promote the up springing of this life in the young finally the last chapter attempts to place the fact of the life of the spirit in its relation to the social order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7580.mp3	and to indicate some of the results which might follow upon its healthy corporate development it is superfluous to point out that each of these subjects needs at least a volume to itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7581.mp3	warm gratitude first to the principal and authorities of manchester college who gave me the opportunity of delivering these chapters in their original form and whose unfailing sympathy and kindness so greatly helped me

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7583.mp3	chapter two roses and thorns by the soft green light in the woody glade on the banks of moss where thy childhood played by the household tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7584.mp3	her mother had been detained at home by a multitude of half reasons none of which anybody fully understood except mister hale who was perfectly aware that all his arguments in favour of a grey satin gown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7585.mp3	which was midway between oldness and newness had proved unavailing and that as he had not the money to equip his wife afresh from top to toe she would not show herself at her only sister's only child's wedding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7586.mp3	if missus shaw had guessed at the real reason why missus hale did not accompany her husband she would have showered down gowns upon her but it was nearly twenty years since missus shaw had been the poor pretty miss beresford
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7587.mp3	and she had really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age in married life on which she could descant by the half hour dearest maria had married the man of her heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7588.mp3	only eight years older than herself with the sweetest temper and that blue black hair one so seldom sees mister hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had ever heard and a perfect model of a parish priest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7589.mp3	perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all these premises but it was still missus shaw's characteristic conclusion as she thought over her sister's lot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7590.mp3	missus hale if she spoke truth might have answered with a ready made list
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7591.mp3	a white chip bonnet oh dozens of things for the wedding and hundreds of things for the house margaret only knew that her mother had not found it convenient to come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7592.mp3	and she was not sorry to think that their meeting and greeting would take place at helstone parsonage rather than during the confusion of the last two or three days in the house in harley street where she herself had had to play the part of figaro
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7593.mp3	and was wanted everywhere at one and the same time her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within the last forty eight hours the farewells so hurriedly taken amongst all the other good byes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7594.mp3	of those she had lived with so long oppressed her now with a sad regret for the times that were no more it did not signify what those times had been they were gone never to return margaret's heart felt more heavy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7595.mp3	the place and the life she had longed for for years at that time of all times for yearning and longing just before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7596.mp3	her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage his blue black hair was grey now and lay thinly over his brows the bones of his face were plainly to be seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7597.mp3	too plainly for beauty if his features had been less finely cut as it was they had a grace if not a comeliness of their own the face was in repose but it was rather rest after weariness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7598.mp3	than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led a placid contented life margaret was painfully struck by the worn anxious expression and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her father's life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7599.mp3	to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression poor frederick thought she sighing oh if frederick had but been a clergyman instead of going into the navy and being lost to us all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7600.mp3	i wish i knew all about it i never understood it from aunt shaw i only knew he could not come back to england because of that terrible affair poor dear papa how sad he looks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7601.mp3	i am so glad i am going home to be at hand to comfort him and mamma she was ready with a bright smile in which there was not a trace of fatigue to greet her father when he awakened he smiled back again but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7602.mp3	faintly as if it were an unusual exertion his face returned into its lines of habitual anxiety he had a trick of half opening his mouth as if to speak which constantly unsettled the form of the lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7603.mp3	and gave the face an undecided expression but he had the same large soft eyes as his daughter eyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits and were well veiled by their transparent white eyelids
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7604.mp3	no rosebud that could only open just enough to let out a yes and no and an't please you sir but the wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips and the skin if not white and fair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7605.mp3	was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy if the look on her face was in general too dignified and reserved for one so young now talking to her father it was bright as the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7606.mp3	full of dimples and glances that spoke of childish gladness and boundless hope in the future it was the latter part of july when margaret returned home the forest trees were all one dark full dusky green
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7607.mp3	the fern below them caught all the slanting sunbeams the weather was sultry and broodingly still margaret used to tramp along by her father's side crushing down the fern with a cruel glee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7608.mp3	as she felt it yield under her light foot and send up the fragrance peculiar to it out on the broad commons into the warm scented light seeing multitudes of wild free living creatures revelling in the sunshine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7609.mp3	this life at least these walks realised all margaret's anticipations she took a pride in her forest its people were her people she made hearty friends with them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7610.mp3	learned and delighted in using their peculiar words took up her freedom amongst them nursed their babies talked or read with slow distinctness to their old people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7611.mp3	carried dainty messes to their sick resolved before long to teach at the school where her father went every day as to an appointed task but she was continually tempted off to go and see some individual friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7612.mp3	man woman or child in some cottage in the green shade of the forest her out of doors life was perfect her in doors life had its drawbacks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7613.mp3	with the healthy shame of a child she blamed herself for her keenness of sight in perceiving that all was not as it should be there her mother her mother always so kind and tender towards her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7614.mp3	but every day he was more overpowered the world became more bewildering at each repeated urgency of his wife that he would put himself in the way of seeking some preferment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7615.mp3	and margaret would try to tempt her forth on to the beautiful broad upland sun streaked cloud shadowed common for she was sure that her mother had accustomed herself too much to an in doors life seldom extending her walks beyond the church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7616.mp3	the school and the neighbouring cottages this did good for a time but when the autumn drew on and the weather became more changeable her mother's idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7617.mp3	and she repined even more frequently that her husband who was more learned than mister hume a better parish priest than mister houldsworth should not have met with the preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7618.mp3	that she should have to give up many luxuries which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in harley street her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure was balanced finely if not overbalanced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7619.mp3	by her conscious pride in being able to do without them all if need were but the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it there had been slight complaints and passing regrets on her mother's part
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7620.mp3	not so pleasant in the latter half of september the autumnal rains and storms came on and margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7621.mp3	helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their own standard of cultivation it is undoubtedly one of the most out of the way places in england said missus hale in one of her plaintive moods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7622.mp3	if we only lived at the other side of the parish it would be something there we should be almost within walking distance of the stansfields certainly the gormans would be within a walk gormans said margaret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7623.mp3	are those the gormans who made their fortunes in trade at southampton oh i'm glad we don't visit them i don't like shoppy people i think we are far better off knowing only cottagers and labourers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7624.mp3	i call mine a very comprehensive taste i like all people whose occupations have to do with land i like soldiers and sailors and the three learned professions as they call them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7625.mp3	and with the soft violence of the west wind behind her as she crossed some heath she seemed to be borne onwards as lightly and easily as the fallen leaf that was wafted along by the autumnal breeze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7626.mp3	but the evenings were rather difficult to fill up agreeably immediately after tea her father withdrew into his small library and she and her mother were left alone missus hale had never cared much for books
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7627.mp3	and had discouraged her husband very early in their married life in his desire of reading aloud to her while she worked at one time they had tried backgammon as a resource but as mister hale grew to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7628.mp3	he found that the interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife not to be accepted as the natural conditions of his profession but to be regretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7629.mp3	so he withdrew while the children were yet young into his library to spend his evenings if he were at home in reading the speculative and metaphysical books which were his delight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7630.mp3	when margaret had been here before she had brought down with her a great box of books recommended by masters or governess and had found the summer's day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return to town
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7631.mp3	now there were only the well bound little read english classics which were weeded out of her father's library to fill up the small book shelves in the drawing room thomson's seasons hayley's cowper middleton's cicero

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7634.mp3	once or twice margaret found herself mechanically counting the repetition of the monotonous sound while she wondered if she might venture to put a question on a subject very near to her heart and ask where frederick was now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7635.mp3	the full account of which margaret had never heard and which now seemed doomed to be buried in sad oblivion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7636.mp3	when she was with her mother her father seemed the best person to apply to for information and when with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7637.mp3	his room was kept exactly as he had left it and was regularly dusted and put into order by dixon missus hale's maid who touched no other part of the household work

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7640.mp3	he would be depressed for many days after witnessing a death bed or hearing of any crime but now margaret noticed an absence of mind as if his thoughts were pre occupied by some subject

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7646.mp3	before winter fairly set in accordingly she was busy preparing her board one morning when sarah the housemaid threw wide open the drawing room door and announced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7647.mp3	snow white rose red just before thanksgiving the affairs of the simpsons reached what might have been called a crisis even in their family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7648.mp3	which had been born and reared in a state of adventurous poverty and perilous uncertainty riverboro was doing its best to return the entire tribe of simpsons to the land of its fathers so to speak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7649.mp3	thinking rightly that the town which had given them birth rather than the town of their adoption should feed them and keep a roof over their heads until the children were of an age for self support there was little to eat in the household
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7650.mp3	and less to wear though missus simpson did as always her poor best the children managed to satisfy their appetites by sitting modestly outside their neighbors kitchen doors when meals were about to be served
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7651.mp3	they were not exactly popular favorites but they did receive certain undesirable morsels from the more charitable housewives life was rather dull and dreary however and in the chill and gloom of november weather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7652.mp3	with the vision of other people's turkeys bursting with fat and other people's golden pumpkins and squashes and corn being garnered into barns the young simpsons groped about for some inexpensive form of excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7653.mp3	and settled upon the selling of soap for a premium they had sold enough to their immediate neighbors during the earlier autumn to secure a child's handcart which though very weak on its pins could be trundled over the country roads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7654.mp3	with large business sagacity and an executive capacity which must have been inherited from their father they now proposed to extend their operations to a larger area and distribute soap to contiguous villages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7655.mp3	if these villages could be induced to buy the excelsior soap company paid a very small return of any kind to its infantile agents who were scattered through the state but it inflamed their imaginations by the issue of circulars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7656.mp3	with highly colored pictures of the premiums to be awarded for the sale of a certain number of cakes it was at this juncture that clara belle and susan simpson consulted rebecca who threw herself solidly and wholeheartedly into the enterprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7657.mp3	promising her help and that of emma jane perkins the premiums within their possible grasp were three a bookcase a plush reclining chair and a banquet lamp of course the simpsons had no books
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7658.mp3	and casting aside without thought or pang the plush chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7659.mp3	not counting mister simpson who ordinarily sat elsewhere at the town's expense they warmed themselves rapturously in the vision of the banquet lamp which speedily became to them more desirable than food drink or clothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7660.mp3	neither emma jane nor rebecca perceived anything incongruous in the idea of the simpsons striving for a banquet lamp they looked at the picture daily and knew that if they themselves were free agents they would toil suffer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7661.mp3	ay sweat for the happy privilege of occupying the same room with that lamp through the coming winter evenings it looked to be about eight feet tall in the catalogue and emma jane advised clara belle to measure the height of the simpson ceilings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7662.mp3	but a note in the margin of the circular informed them that it stood two and a half feet high when set up in all its dignity and splendor on a proper table three dollars extra it was only of polished brass continued the circular
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7663.mp3	though it was invariably mistaken for solid gold and the shade that accompanied it at least it accompanied it if the agent sold a hundred extra cakes was of crinkled crepe paper printed in a dozen delicious hues
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7664.mp3	from which the joy dazzled agent might take his choice seesaw simpson was not in the syndicate clara belle was rather a successful agent but susan who could only say thoap never made large returns
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7665.mp3	and the twins who were somewhat young to be thoroughly trustworthy could be given only a half dozen cakes at a time and were obliged to carry with them on their business trips a brief document stating the price per cake dozen and box
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7666.mp3	rebecca and emma jane offered to go two or three miles in some one direction and see what they could do in the way of stirring up a popular demand for the snow white and rose red brands the former being devoted to laundry purposes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7667.mp3	and the latter being intended for the toilet there was a great amount of hilarity in the preparation for this event and a long council in emma jane's attic they had the soap company's circular from which to arrange a proper speech
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7668.mp3	and they had what was still better the remembrance of a certain patent medicine vender's discourse at the milltown fair his method when once observed could never be forgotten nor his manner nor his vocabulary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7669.mp3	emma jane practiced it on rebecca and rebecca on emma jane can i sell you a little soap this afternoon it is called the snow white and rose red soap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7670.mp3	six cakes in an ornamental box only twenty cents for the white twenty five cents for the red it is made from the purest ingredients and if desired could be eaten by an invalid with relish and profit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7671.mp3	oh rebecca don't let's say that interposed emma jane hysterically it makes me feel like a fool it takes so little to make you feel like a fool emma jane rebuked rebecca that sometimes i think that you must be one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7672.mp3	i don't get to feeling like a fool so awfully easy now leave out that eating part if you don't like it and go on the snow white is probably the most remarkable laundry soap ever manufactured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7673.mp3	immerse the garments in a tub lightly rubbing the more soiled portions with the soap leave them submerged in water from sunset to sunrise and then the youngest baby can wash them without the slightest effort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7674.mp3	babe not baby corrected rebecca from the circular it's just the same thing argued emma jane of course it's just the same thing but a baby has got to be called babe or infant in a circular
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7675.mp3	the same as it is in poetry would you rather say infant no grumbled emma jane infant is worse even than babe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7676.mp3	and let elijah or elisha try the soap before we begin selling i can't imagine a babe doing a family wash with any soap answered rebecca but it must be true or they would never dare to print it so don't let's bother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7677.mp3	oh won't it be the greatest fun emma jane at some of the houses where they can't possibly know me i shan't be frightened and i shall reel off the whole rigmarole invalid babe and all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7678.mp3	perhaps i shall say even the last sentence if i can remember it we sound every chord in the great mac ro cosm of satisfaction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7679.mp3	this conversation took place on a friday afternoon at emma jane's house where rebecca to her unbounded joy was to stay over sunday her aunts having gone to portland to the funeral of an old friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7680.mp3	saturday being a holiday they were going to have the old white horse drive to north riverboro three miles away eat a twelve o'clock dinner with emma jane's cousins and be back at four o'clock punctually
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7681.mp3	when the children asked missus perkins if they could call at just a few houses coming and going and sell a little soap for the simpsons she at first replied decidedly in the negative
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7682.mp3	she was an indulgent parent however and really had little objection to emma jane amusing herself in this unusual way it was only for rebecca as the niece of the difficult miranda sawyer that she raised scruples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7683.mp3	but when fully persuaded that the enterprise was a charitable one she acquiesced the girls called at mister watson's store and arranged for several large boxes of soap to be charged to clara belle simpson's account
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7684.mp3	these were lifted into the back of the wagon and a happier couple never drove along the country road than rebecca and her companion it was a glorious indian summer day which suggested nothing of thanksgiving near at hand as it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7685.mp3	it was a rustly day a scarlet and buff yellow and carmine bronze and crimson day there were still many leaves on the oaks and maples making a goodly show of red and brown and gold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7686.mp3	the air was like sparkling cider and every field had its heaps of yellow and russet good things to eat all ready for the barns the mills and the markets the horse forgot his twenty years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7687.mp3	sniffed the sweet bright air and trotted like a colt nokomis mountain looked blue and clear in the distance rebecca stood in the wagon and apostrophized the landscape with sudden joy of living
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7688.mp3	great wide beautiful wonderful world with the wonderful water round you curled and the wonderful grass upon your breast world you are beautifully drest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7689.mp3	dull emma jane had never seemed to rebecca so near so dear so tried and true and rebecca to emma jane's faithful heart had never been so brilliant so bewildering so fascinating as in this visit together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7690.mp3	with its intimacy its freedom and the added delights of an exciting business enterprise a gorgeous leaf blew into the wagon does color make you sort of dizzy asked rebecca
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7691.mp3	no it don't not a mite perhaps dizzy isn't just the right word but it's nearest i'd like to eat color and drink it and sleep in it if you could be a tree which one would you choose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7692.mp3	emma jane had enjoyed considerable experience of this kind and rebecca had succeeded in unstopping her ears ungluing her eyes and loosening her tongue so that she could play the game after a fashion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7693.mp3	i'd rather be an apple tree in blossom that one that blooms pink by our pig pen rebecca laughed there was always something unexpected in emma jane's replies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7694.mp3	i'd choose to be that scarlet maple just on the edge of the pond there and she pointed with the whip then i could see so much more than your pink apple tree by the pig pen i could look at all the rest of the woods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7695.mp3	see my scarlet dress in my beautiful looking glass and watch all the yellow and brown trees growing upside down in the water when i'm old enough to earn money i'm going to have a dress like this leaf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7696.mp3	then i think i'll have a brown sash like the trunk of the tree and where could i be green do they have green petticoats i wonder i'd like a green petticoat coming out now and then underneath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7697.mp3	to show what my leaves were like before i was a scarlet maple i think it would be awful homely said emma jane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7698.mp3	with a pink sash pink stockings bronze slippers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7699.mp3	they did not accompany each other to the doors of their chosen victims feeling sure that together they could not approach the subject seriously but they parted at the gate of each house the one holding the horse while the other took the soap samples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7700.mp3	and interviewed any one who seemed of a coming on disposition emma jane had disposed of three single cakes rebecca of three small boxes for a difference in their ability to persuade the public was clearly defined at the start
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7701.mp3	though neither of them ascribed either success or defeat to anything but the imperious force of circumstances housewives looked at emma jane and desired no soap listened to her description of its merits and still desired none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7702.mp3	other stars in their courses governed rebecca's doings the people whom she interviewed either remembered their present need of soap or reminded themselves that they would need it in the future the notable point in the case being
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7703.mp3	that lucky rebecca accomplished with almost no effort results that poor little emma jane failed to attain by hard and conscientious labor it's your turn rebecca and i'm glad too said emma jane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7704.mp3	drawing up to a gateway and indicating a house that was set a considerable distance from the road i haven't got over trembling from the last place yet a lady had put her head out of an upstairs window and called
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7705.mp3	go away little girl whatever you have in your box we don't want any i don't know who lives here and the blinds are all shut in front if there's nobody at home you mustn't count it but take the next house as yours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7706.mp3	rebecca walked up the lane and went to the side door there was a porch there and seated in a rocking chair husking corn was a good looking young man or was he middle aged rebecca could not make up her mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7707.mp3	at all events he had an air of the city about him well shaven face well trimmed mustache well fitting clothes rebecca was a trifle shy at this unexpected encounter but there was nothing to be done but explain her presence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7708.mp3	so she asked is the lady of the house at home i am the lady of the house at present said the stranger with a whimsical smile what can i do for you have you ever heard of the would you like or i mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7709.mp3	do you need any soap queried rebecca do i look as if i did he responded unexpectedly rebecca dimpled i didn't mean that i have some soap to sell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7710.mp3	i mean i would like to introduce to you a very remarkable soap the best now on the market it is called the oh i must know that soap said the gentleman genially made out of pure vegetable fats isn't it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7711.mp3	the very purest corroborated rebecca no acid in it not a trace and yet a child could do the monday washing with it and use no force a babe corrected rebecca
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7712.mp3	wise child this was great good fortune to find a customer who knew all the virtues of the article in advance rebecca dimpled more and more and at her new friend's invitation sat down on a stool at his side near the edge of the porch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7713.mp3	and the prices of both that and the snow white were unfolded presently she forgot all about her silent partner at the gate and was talking as if she had known this grand personage all her life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7714.mp3	i'm keeping house to day but i don't live here explained the delightful gentleman i'm just on a visit to my aunt who has gone to portland i used to be here as a boy and i am very fond of the spot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7715.mp3	i don't think anything takes the place of the farm where one lived when one was a child observed rebecca nearly bursting with pride at having at last successfully used the indefinite pronoun in general conversation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7716.mp3	so you consider your childhood a thing of the past do you young lady i can still remember it answered rebecca gravely though it seems a long time ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7717.mp3	i can remember mine well enough and a particularly unpleasant one it was said the stranger so was mine sighed rebecca what was your worst trouble lack of food and clothes principally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7718.mp3	oh exclaimed rebecca sympathetically mine was no shoes and too many babies and not enough books but you're all right and happy now aren't you she asked doubtfully for though he looked handsome well fed and prosperous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7719.mp3	any child could see that his eyes were tired and his mouth was sad when he was not speaking i'm doing pretty well thank you said the man with a delightful smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7720.mp3	how much has your aunt on hand now suggested the very modest and inexperienced agent and how much would she need
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7721.mp3	i'm not certain said rebecca conscientiously but i'll look in the circular it's sure to tell and she drew the document from her pocket what are you going to do with the magnificent profits you get from this business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7722.mp3	we are not selling for our own benefit said rebecca confidentially my friend who is holding the horse at the gate is the daughter of a very rich blacksmith and doesn't need any money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7723.mp3	we are trying to get a premium for some friends of ours rebecca had never thought of alluding to the circumstances with her previous customers but unexpectedly she found herself describing mister simpson missus simpson and the simpson family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7724.mp3	their poverty their joyless life and their abject need of a banquet lamp to brighten their existence you needn't argue that point laughed the man as he stood up to get a glimpse of the rich blacksmith's daughter at the gate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7725.mp3	i can see that they ought to have it if they want it and especially if you want them to have it i've known what it was myself to do without a banquet lamp now give me the circular and let's do some figuring how much do the simpsons lack at this moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7726.mp3	if they sell two hundred more cakes this month and next they can have the lamp by christmas rebecca answered and they can get a shade by summer time but i'm afraid i can't help very much after to day because my aunt miranda may not like to have me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7727.mp3	i see well that's all right i'll take three hundred cakes and that will give them shade and all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7728.mp3	tipped over and disappeared into a clump of lilac bushes it was a very short distance fortunately and the amused capitalist picked her up set her on her feet and brushed her off you should never seem surprised when you have taken a large order said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7729.mp3	you ought to have replied can't you make it three hundred and fifty instead of capsizing in that unbusinesslike way oh i could never say anything like that exclaimed rebecca who was blushing crimson at her awkward fall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7730.mp3	but it doesn't seem right for you to buy so much are you sure you can afford it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7731.mp3	what if your aunt shouldn't like the kind of soap queried rebecca nervously my aunt always likes what i like he returned mine doesn't exclaimed rebecca then there's something wrong with your aunt or with me laughed rebecca
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7732.mp3	what is your name young lady rebecca rowena randall sir what with an amused smile both your mother was generous she couldn't bear to give up either of the names she says
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7733.mp3	i think i know already answered rebecca with a bright glance i'm sure you must be mister aladdin in the arabian nights oh please can i run down and tell emma jane she must be so tired waiting and she will be so glad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7734.mp3	at the man's nod of assent rebecca sped down the lane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7735.mp3	oh emma jane emma jane we are sold out mister aladdin followed smilingly to corroborate this astonishing unbelievable statement lifted all their boxes from the back of the wagon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7736.mp3	and taking the circular promised to write to the excelsior company that night concerning the premium if you could contrive to keep a secret you two little girls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7737.mp3	it would be rather a nice surprise to have the lamp arrive at the simpsons on thanksgiving day wouldn't it he asked as he tucked the old lap robe cosily over their feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7738.mp3	oh don't mention it laughed mister aladdin lifting his hat i was a sort of commercial traveler myself once years ago and i like to see the thing well done good by miss rebecca rowena
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7739.mp3	just let me know whenever you have anything to sell for i'm certain beforehand i shall want it good by mister aladdin i surely will cried rebecca tossing back her dark braids delightedly and waving her hand oh rebecca said emma jane in an awe struck whisper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7740.mp3	he raised his hat to us and we not thirteen it'll be five years before we're ladies never mind answered rebecca we are the beginnings of ladies even now he tucked the lap robe round us too continued emma jane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7741.mp3	in an ecstasy of reminiscence oh isn't he perfectly elergant and wasn't it lovely of him to buy us out and just think of having both the lamp and the shade for one day's work aren't you glad you wore your pink gingham now

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7749.mp3	diana is invited to tea with tragic results october was a beautiful month at green gables
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7750.mp3	when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7751.mp3	anne reveled in the world of color about her oh marilla she exclaimed one saturday morning coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7752.mp3	it would be terrible if we just skipped from september to november wouldn't it look at these maple branches don't they give you a thrill several thrills i'm going to decorate my room with them messy things said marilla whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7753.mp3	you clutter up your room entirely too much with out of doors stuff anne bedrooms were made to sleep in oh and dream in too marilla and you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7754.mp3	i'm going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table mind you don't drop leaves all over the stairs then i'm going on a meeting of the aid society at carmody this afternoon anne and i won't likely be home before dark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7755.mp3	it was dreadful of me to forget said anne apologetically but that was the afternoon i was trying to think of a name for violet vale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7756.mp3	so he didn't find the time long at all it was a beautiful fairy story marilla i forgot the end of it so i made up an end for it myself and matthew said he couldn't tell where the join came in matthew would think it all right anne if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7757.mp3	but you keep your wits about you this time and i don't really know if i'm doing right it may make you more addlepated than ever but you can ask diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here oh marilla anne clasped her hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7758.mp3	how perfectly lovely you are able to imagine things after all or else you'd never have understood how i've longed for that very thing it will seem so nice and grown uppish no fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when i have company oh marilla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7759.mp3	can i use the rosebud spray tea set no indeed the rosebud tea set well what next you know i never use that except for the minister or the aids
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7760.mp3	you'll put down the old brown tea set but you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves it's time it was being used anyhow i believe it's beginning to work and you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7761.mp3	i can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea said anne shutting her eyes ecstatically and asking diana if she takes sugar i know she doesn't but of course i'll ask her just as if i didn't know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7762.mp3	and then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves oh marilla it's a wonderful sensation just to think of it can i take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes and then into the parlor to sit no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7763.mp3	the sitting room will do for you and your company but there's a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night it's on the second shelf of the sitting room closet and you and diana can have it if you like
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7764.mp3	anne flew down to the hollow past the dryad's bubble and up the spruce path to orchard slope to ask diana to tea as a result just after marilla had driven off to carmody diana came over dressed in her second best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7765.mp3	at other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking but now she knocked primly at the front door and when anne dressed in her second best as primly opened it both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7766.mp3	how is your mother inquired anne politely just as if she had not seen missus barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits she is very well thank you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7767.mp3	yes our potato crop is very good this year i hope your father's crop is good too it is fairly good thank you have you picked many of your apples yet oh ever so many said anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7768.mp3	let's go out to the orchard and get some of the red sweetings diana marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree marilla is a very generous woman she said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7769.mp3	they taste twice as good as any other color the orchard with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7770.mp3	diana had much to tell anne of what went on in school she had to sit with gertie pye and she hated it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7771.mp3	ruby gillis had charmed all her warts away true's you live with a magic pebble that old mary joe from the creek gave her

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7773.mp3	and mattie andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening and lizzie wright didn't speak to mamie wilson because mamie wilson's grown up sister had cut out lizzie wright's grown up sister with her beau
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7774.mp3	and everybody missed anne so and wished she's come to school again and gilbert blythe but anne didn't want to hear about gilbert blythe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7775.mp3	anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there search revealed it away back on the top shelf anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7776.mp3	now please help yourself diana she said politely i don't believe i'll have any just now i don't feel as if i wanted any after all those apples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7777.mp3	diana poured herself out a tumblerful looked at its bright red hue admiringly and then sipped it daintily that's awfully nice raspberry cordial anne she said i didn't know raspberry cordial was so nice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7778.mp3	there are so many responsibilities on a person's mind when they're keeping house isn't there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7779.mp3	the tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice the nicest i ever drank said diana it's ever so much nicer than missus lynde's although she brags of hers so much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7780.mp3	it doesn't taste a bit like hers i should think marilla's raspberry cordial would prob'ly be much nicer than missus lynde's said anne loyally marilla is a famous cook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7781.mp3	i was thinking the loveliest story about you and me diana i thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you but i went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7782.mp3	and then i took the smallpox and died and i was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7783.mp3	oh it was such a pathetic tale diana the tears just rained down over my cheeks while i mixed the cake but i forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure flour is so essential to cakes you know marilla was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7784.mp3	very cross and i don't wonder i'm a great trial to her she was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week we had a plum pudding for dinner on tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7785.mp3	marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it i meant to cover it just as much as could be diana but when i carried it in i was imagining i was a nun of course i'm a protestant but i imagined i was a catholic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7786.mp3	taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion and i forgot all about covering the pudding sauce i thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry diana
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7787.mp3	fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce i lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then i washed the spoon in three waters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7788.mp3	but when she did come in i was imagining that i was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow whichever they wanted to be so i never thought about the pudding sauce again and marilla sent me out to pick apples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7789.mp3	you know they are very stylish people especially missus chester ross
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7790.mp3	i tried to be as polite and dignified as i could be for i wanted missus chester ross to think i was a ladylike little girl even if i wasn't pretty everything went right until i saw marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce warmed up in the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7791.mp3	diana that was a terrible moment i remembered everything and i just stood up in my place and shrieked out marilla you mustn't use that pudding sauce there was a mouse drowned in it i forgot to tell you before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7792.mp3	oh diana i shall never forget that awful moment if i live to be a hundred missus chester ross just looked at me and i thought i would sink through the floor with mortification
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7793.mp3	she is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word then she just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves she even offered me some
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7794.mp3	but i couldn't swallow a mouthful it was like heaping coals of fire on my head after missus chester ross went away marilla gave me a dreadful scolding why diana what is the matter diana had stood up very unsteadily then she sat down again putting her hands to her head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7795.mp3	i'm i'm awful sick she said a little thickly i i must go right home oh you mustn't dream of going home without your tea cried anne in distress i'll get it right off i'll go and put the tea down this very minute
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7796.mp3	i must go home repeated diana stupidly but determinedly let me get you a lunch anyhow implored anne let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves lie down on the sofa for a little while and you'll be better where do you feel bad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7797.mp3	i must go home said diana and that was all she would say in vain anne pleaded i never heard of company going home without tea she mourned oh diana do you suppose that it's possible you're really taking the smallpox
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7798.mp3	if you are i'll go and nurse you you can depend on that i'll never forsake you but i do wish you'd stay till after tea where do you feel bad i'm awful dizzy said diana and indeed she walked very dizzily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7799.mp3	got diana's hat and went with her as far as the barry yard fence then she wept all the way back to green gables where she sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for matthew and jerry with all the zest gone out of the performance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7800.mp3	and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk anne did not stir abroad from green gables monday afternoon marilla sent her down to missus lynde's on an errand in a very short space of time anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her cheeks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7801.mp3	into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony whatever has gone wrong now anne queried marilla in doubt and dismay i do hope you haven't gone and been saucy to missus lynde again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7802.mp3	no answer from anne save more tears and stormier sobs anne shirley when i ask you a question i want to be answered sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about anne sat up tragedy personified
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7803.mp3	missus lynde was up to see missus barry today and missus barry was in an awful state she wailed she says that i set diana drunk saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7804.mp3	and she says i must be a thoroughly bad wicked little girl and she's never never going to let diana play with me again oh marilla i'm just overcome with woe marilla stared in blank amazement set diana drunk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7805.mp3	she said when she found her voice anne are you or missus barry crazy what on earth did you give her not a thing but raspberry cordial sobbed anne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7806.mp3	not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as diana did oh it sounds so so like missus thomas's husband but i didn't mean to set her drunk drunk fiddlesticks said marilla marching to the sitting room pantry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7807.mp3	although certain of the stricter sort missus barry among them disapproved strongly of it and at the same time marilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7808.mp3	she went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand her face was twitching in spite of herself anne you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble you went and gave diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7809.mp3	didn't you know the difference yourself i never tasted it said anne i thought it was the cordial i meant to be so so hospitable diana got awfully sick and had to go home missus barry told missus lynde she was simply dead drunk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7810.mp3	she just laughed silly like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hours her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk she had a fearful headache all day yesterday missus barry is so indignant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7811.mp3	she will never believe but what i did it on purpose i should think she would better punish diana for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything said marilla shortly why three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7812.mp3	well this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine although i haven't made any for three years ever since i found out that the minister didn't approve i just kept that bottle for sickness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7813.mp3	there there child don't cry i can't see as you were to blame although i'm sorry it happened so i must cry said anne my heart is broken the stars in their courses fight against me marilla diana and i are parted forever oh marilla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7814.mp3	missus barry will think better of it when she finds you're not to blame i suppose she thinks you've done it for a silly joke or something of that sort you'd best go up this evening and tell her how it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7815.mp3	my courage fails me at the thought of facing diana's injured mother sighed anne i wish you'd go marilla you're so much more dignified than i am likely she'd listen to you quicker than to me well i will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7816.mp3	said marilla reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course don't cry any more anne it will be all right marilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got back from orchard slope anne was watching for her coming and flew to the porch door to meet her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7817.mp3	oh marilla i know by your face that it's been no use she said sorrowfully missus barry won't forgive me missus barry indeed snapped marilla of all the unreasonable women i ever saw she's the worst
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7818.mp3	marilla whisked into the kitchen grievously disturbed leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her presently anne stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7819.mp3	very determinedly and steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through the spruce grove lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western woods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7820.mp3	missus barry coming to the door in answer to a timid knock found a white lipped eager eyed suppliant on the doorstep her face hardened missus barry was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes and her anger was of the cold sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7821.mp3	to do her justice she really believed anne had made diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child what do you want she said stiffly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7822.mp3	anne clasped her hands oh missus barry please forgive me i did not mean to to intoxicate diana how could i just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7823.mp3	and you had just one bosom friend in all the world do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose i thought it was only raspberry cordial i was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial oh please don't say that you won't let diana play with me any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7824.mp3	if you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe this speech which would have softened good missus lynde's heart in a twinkling had no effect on missus barry except to irritate her still more she was suspicious of anne's big words and dramatic gestures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7825.mp3	and imagined that the child was making fun of her so she said coldly and cruelly i don't think you are a fit little girl for diana to associate with you'd better go home and behave yourself anne's lips quivered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7826.mp3	won't you let me see diana just once to say farewell she implored diana has gone over to carmody with her father said missus barry going in and shutting the door anne went back to green gables calm with despair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7827.mp3	my last hope is gone she told marilla i went up and saw missus barry myself and she treated me very insultingly marilla i do not think she is a well bred woman there is nothing more to do except to pray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7828.mp3	anne you shouldn't say such things rebuked marilla striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find growing upon her and indeed when she told the whole story to matthew that night she did laugh heartily over anne's tribulations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7829.mp3	but when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her face poor little soul she murmured
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7830.mp3	how fearful and dizzy tis to cast one's eyes so low i'll look no more

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7847.mp3	it was a desperate chance enough but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies yes i said dear master elzevir let us get to it quickly and if we fall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7848.mp3	tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hale us off to jail and with that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7849.mp3	and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off on to the sward it was a sight to stagger any man and would have made me swoon perhaps but that there was no time for we were at the end of the under cliff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7850.mp3	and twas a task that might cow the bravest and when i looked upon the zigzag it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse than set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7851.mp3	for the zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey white cliff face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7852.mp3	faugh said elzevir tis a poor beast has lost his foothold it was an ill omen enough and i said as much beseeching him to make his own way up the zigzag
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7853.mp3	and leave me where i was for that they might have mercy on a boy tush he cried it is thy heart that fails thee and tis too late now to change counsel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7854.mp3	we have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with and if we gain the cliff top in that time we shall have an hour's start or more for they will take all that to search the under cliff and maskew too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7855.mp3	will keep them in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7856.mp3	so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open them with that he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7857.mp3	in a minute i knew from elzevir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path even free and untrammelled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7858.mp3	and not a man in all the world to do it with a full grown lad in his arms yet elzevir made no bones of it nor spoke a single word only he went very slow and i felt him scuffle with his foot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7859.mp3	thus he went on for a time that seemed without end and yet was really but a minute or two and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive at all on the under cliff blow fresher and cold on the cliff side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7860.mp3	and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elzevir went slower and slower till at last he spoke john i am going to stop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7861.mp3	but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down and bid thee i did as bidden and he lowered me gently setting me on all fours upon the path and speaking again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7862.mp3	the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7863.mp3	for there is no room to dance hornpipes here and hold thy eyes fixed on the chalk wall looking neither down nor seaward twas well he told me what to do and well i did it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7864.mp3	but spent much time that was so precious in travelling those ten yards to take me round the first elbow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elzevir and he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7865.mp3	forgetting what i suffered cried out quicken thy pace lad if thou canst the time is short now so frail is man's temper that though he was doing more than any ever did to save another's life and was all i had to trust to in the world yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7866.mp3	but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arms so i lay flat on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7867.mp3	and then while he knelt down upon the path
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7868.mp3	putting my arms round his neck and so he bore me pickaback i shut my eyes firm again and thus we moved along another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7869.mp3	both were on all fours now elzevir first and i following but as i crept along i relaxed care for a moment and my eyes wandered from the cliff side and looked down and far below
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7870.mp3	i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror and the gulls wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7871.mp3	felt a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain and knew that i was giddy and must fall then i called out to elzevir and he guessing what had come over me cries to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7872.mp3	and how he did it in such a narrow strait i know not but he turned round and lying down himself thrust his hand firmly in my back pressing me closer to the cliff yet it was none too soon for if he had not held me tight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7873.mp3	i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness keep thine eyes shut john he said and count up numbers loud to me that i may know thou art not turning faint
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7874.mp3	so i gave out one two three and while i went on counting heard him repeating to himself though his words seemed thin and far off we must have taken ten minutes to get here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7875.mp3	and in five more they will be on the under cliff and if we ever reach the top who knows but they have left a guard no no they will not leave a guard for not a man knows of the zigzag and if they knew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7876.mp3	like sitting guillemots against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7877.mp3	thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7878.mp3	i think i could have done it but there was only the cliff wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind was blowing in fresh puffs and though i did not open my eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7879.mp3	i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent grass and the chiding cries of the gulls seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7880.mp3	there is no time to play the woman another minute of this and we are lost pluck up thy courage keep thy eyes to the cliff and forward yet i could not but answered i cannot i cannot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7881.mp3	move thou must and tis better to risk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on and with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar moving backwards himself and setting to drag me after him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7882.mp3	now i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elzevir for all he was so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7883.mp3	so he gave it up leaving go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the under cliff below a sound of voices and shouting zounds they are down already cried elzevir and have found maskew's body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7884.mp3	it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright of falling left me in a moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7885.mp3	and i could open my eyes without a trace of giddiness so i began to move forward again on hands and knees and elzevir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7886.mp3	thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7887.mp3	the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver grey film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7888.mp3	with the straight sunpath across it spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back the relief of being once more on firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7889.mp3	and the wind which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge seemed now but the gentlest of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but this was only for a moment for the anguish came back and grew apace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7890.mp3	and i fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in how things had been against us in these last days first there was losing the why not and that was bad enough second
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7891.mp3	there was the being known by the excise for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7892.mp3	there came before my eyes that grey face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elzevir sat up stretching himself like one waking out of sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7893.mp3	and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us hereabouts but that we cannot risk and must get clear away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7894.mp3	this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in purbeck which they call joseph's pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7895.mp3	and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7896.mp3	that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elzevir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7897.mp3	it was after noon for the sun was past the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7898.mp3	the ground was brashy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields it was a bleak wide bitten place enough looking as if twould never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7899.mp3	behind one of these walls broken down in places but held together with straggling ivy and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush elzevir put me down at length and said i am beat and can carry thee no farther for this present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7900.mp3	though there is not now much farther to go we have passed purbeck gates and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance comer pass along the down and as for the soldiers they are not like to come this way so soon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7901.mp3	and if they come i cannot help it for weariness and the sun's heat have made my feet like lead a score of years ago i would have laughed at such a task but now tis different
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7902.mp3	so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see aught moving wake me up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7903.mp3	i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound' and he took maskew's silver butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7904.mp3	with that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall and in a minute i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7905.mp3	and now that i was under the lee of the wall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7906.mp3	and gets at length into shelter moreover though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzevir i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the weariness of pain to lull me to slumber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7907.mp3	then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sward was fell to counting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7908.mp3	that lay at random on the green turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones then i fell to counting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7909.mp3	but would go on for millions and millions and millions and before i had reached ten in so heroic a numeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7910.mp3	and though i could see nothing i knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elzevir but he was already full awake and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7911.mp3	enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen he dropped down again with a look of relief and said tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he makes this way a minute later he said the boy is coming straight for the wall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7912.mp3	we shall have to show ourselves and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall and so elzevir stood up the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7913.mp3	but elzevir passed him the time of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave it back what are you doing here son block asked scaring rooks for farmer topp was the answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7914.mp3	have you got a charge of powder to spare said elzevir showing his pistol i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask maybe you've seen a flask in walking through the furrows he whispered to me to lie still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7915.mp3	no time was wasted in words elzevir had the flask in his pocket and the boy was biting the crown what shot have you said elzevir what have you dropped your shot flask too asked the boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7916.mp3	and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7917.mp3	but thou must pay a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or buzzard or something fit to cook come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling if thou art beat be beat for something more says elzevir the tempter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7918.mp3	the smugglers got off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7919.mp3	for while he spoke i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied round my leg tis for that very reason says elzevir that i want the firelock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7920.mp3	these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hill side come come thou dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7921.mp3	and so i said as much to elzevir who only laughed saying the boy was simple and harmless but from where i sat i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7922.mp3	but when elzevir sat down the boy gave a careful look round and seeing no one watching any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7923.mp3	then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the hue and cry but before elzevir was on his feet again the boy was out of sight over the hill brow let us move on said block tis but a little distance now to go and the heat is past already
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7924.mp3	we must have slept three hours or more for thou art but a sorry watchman john tis when the sentry sleeps that the enemy laughs and for thee the posse might have had us both like daylight owls with that he took me on his back and made off with a lusty stride
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7925.mp3	and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7926.mp3	elzevir was still walking strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carried and in less than half an hour i knew though i had never been there before we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of anvil point
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7927.mp3	although i knew little of these quarries and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learnt much about them out of such excavations comes that black purbeck marble which you see in old churches in our country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7928.mp3	and i am told in other parts of england as well and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned askew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred feet deep then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7929.mp3	from the bottom of this shaft there spread out narrow passages or tunnels mostly six feet high but sometimes only three or four and in these the marble is dug these quarries were made by men centuries ago some say by the romans themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7930.mp3	which was just putting on the brighter green of spring this turf was not smooth but hummocky for under it lay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago which the green vestment had covered for the most part
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7931.mp3	though it left sometimes a little patch of broken rubble peering out at the top of a mound there were many tumble down walls and low gables left of the cottages of the old quarrymen grass covered ridges marked out the little garden folds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7932.mp3	and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7933.mp3	on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of the shafts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7934.mp3	for if it were not for this holy purpose the mandrive would have power to strangle the man that hewed it it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elzevir laid me down at last the light was very low
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7935.mp3	and the sward crept over the edges of the hole and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole and ruddy brown brambles overgrew the steps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7936.mp3	there he said this is joseph's pit and here we must lie hid until thy foot is sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hue and cry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7937.mp3	and before they come to where we lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps back first as one goes down a hatchway
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7938.mp3	and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that dear village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7939.mp3	he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders and screened my dangling leg from getting caught thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we got there all was dark but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7940.mp3	and walked on as if he knew the way i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7941.mp3	and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and lit a match
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7942.mp3	as rawdon in his evening costume which he had now worn two days passed by the scared female who was scouring the steps and entered into his brother's study lady jane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7943.mp3	in her morning gown was up and above stairs in the nursery superintending the toilettes of her children and listening to the morning prayers which the little creatures performed at her knee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7944.mp3	every morning she and they performed this duty privately and before the public ceremonial at which sir pitt presided and at which all the people of the household were expected to assemble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7945.mp3	rawdon sat down in the study before the baronet's table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7946.mp3	and the letters the neatly docketed bills and symmetrical pamphlets the locked account books desks and dispatch boxes the bible the quarterly review and the court guide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7947.mp3	on the study table and awaiting his judicious selection and by the sermon book was the observer newspaper damp and neatly folded and for sir pitt's own private use
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7948.mp3	he had read in the journal a flaming account of festivities at gaunt house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7949.mp3	invited by the marquis of steyne to meet his royal highness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/7950.mp3	and her niece as they were taking early tea and hot buttered toast in the former lady's apartment and wondered how the rawding crawleys could git on the valet had damped and folded the paper once more

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8136.mp3	was the unexpected sympathy and understanding of one of the government doctors

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8147.mp3	seize these women take them off that one that one take her off the guards rushed forward and an almost indescribable scene of violent confusion ensued i saw one of the guards seize her lucy burns
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8148.mp3	by the arms twist or force them back of her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8149.mp3	and put it on in order to prepare myself if attacked i was trembling at the time and was stunned with terror at the situation as it had developed and said to the superintendent i will give my name under protest and started to walk towards the desk whereon lay the books the superintendent shouted to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8150.mp3	i saw the guards seizing the different women of the party with the utmost violence the furniture being overturned and the room a scene of the utmost disturbance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8151.mp3	i saw miss lincoln lying on the floor with every appearance of having just been thrown down by the two guards who were standing over her in a menacing attitude seeing the general disturbance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8152.mp3	i gave up all idea of giving my name at the desk and instinctively joined my companions to go with them and share whatever was in store for them the whole group of women were thrown dragged or herded out of the office on to the porch down the steps to the ground and forced to cross the road
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8153.mp3	to the administration building during all of this time superintendent whittaker was directing the whole attack all of us were thrown into different cells in the men's prison i being put in one with four other women the cell containing a narrow bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8154.mp3	and one chair which was immediately removed during the time that we were being forced into the cells the guards kept up an uproar shouting banging the iron doors clanging bars making a terrifying noise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8155.mp3	i and one of my companions were lying down on the narrow bed on which were a blanket and one pillow the door of the cell was opened and a mattress and a blanket being thrown in the door was violently banged to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8156.mp3	and lay down covering themselves with the blanket i looked across the corridor and saw miss lincoln and asked her whether she was all right being anxious to know whether she had been hurt by the treatment in the office building instantly superintendent whittaker rushed forward shouting at me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8157.mp3	gag you and put you in a straitjacket i wish to state again that the cells into which we were put were situated in the men's prison
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8158.mp3	and who could at any moment look at us furthermore the water closets were in full view of the corridor where superintendent whittaker and the guards were moving about the flushing of these closets could only be done from the corridor and we were forced to ask the guards to do this for us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8159.mp3	the men who had shortly before attacked us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8160.mp3	i was exhausted by what i had seen and been through and spent the night in absolute terror of further attack and of what might still be in store for us i thought of the young girls who were with us and feared for their safety the guards acted brutal in the extreme
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8161.mp3	incited to their brutal conduct towards us by the superintendent i thought of the offense with which we had been charged merely that of obstructing traffic and felt that the treatment that we had received was out of all proportion to the offense with which we were charged
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8162.mp3	and that the superintendent the matron and guards would not have dared to act towards us as they had acted unless they relied upon the support of higher authorities it seemed to me that everything had been done from the time we reached the workhouse to terrorize us and my fear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8163.mp3	lest the extreme of outrage would be worked upon the young girls of our party became intense it is impossible for me to describe the terror of that night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8164.mp3	the affidavit then continues with the story of how missus brannan was compelled the following morning to put on prison clothes was given a cup of skimmed milk and a slice of toast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8165.mp3	and requested permission to lie down feeling so ill i could not sleep having a sense of constant danger i was almost paralyzed and in wretched physical condition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8166.mp3	seven of us being in the party we were so exhausted and weary that we were obliged to stop constantly to rest on our way back from the walk we heard the baying of hounds very near us in the woods the matron said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8167.mp3	one of the party miss findeisen asked whether they would attack us to which the matron replied that is just what they would do and hurried us along the baying grew louder and nearer at times and then more distant as the dogs rushed back and forth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8168.mp3	and this went on until we reached the sewing room the effect of this upon our nerves can better be imagined than described every conceivable lie was tried in an effort to force the women to abandon their various form of resistance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8169.mp3	they were told that no efforts were being made from the outside to reach them and that their attorney had been called off the case each one was told that she was the only one hunger striking each one was told that all the others had put on prison clothes and were working
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8170.mp3	although they were separated from one another they suspected the lies and remained strong in their resistance after mister o'brien's one visit and the subsequent reports in the press he was thereafter refused admission to the workhouse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8171.mp3	it was evident that the administration was anxious to keep this group away from alice paul and her companions as they counted on handling the rebellion more easily in two groups than one meanwhile the condition of the prisoners in the workhouse grew steadily worse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8172.mp3	we decided to take the only course open to obtain a writ of habeas corpus a hurried journey by counsel to united states district judge waddill of norfolk virginia brought the writ
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8173.mp3	it compelled the government to bring the prisoners into court and show cause why they should not be returned to the district jail this conservative southern judge said of the petition for the writ
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8174.mp3	there followed a week more melodramatic than the most stirring moving picture film although the writ had been applied for in the greatest secrecy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8175.mp3	a detective suddenly appeared to accompany mister o'brien from washington to norfolk during his stay in norfolk and back to washington telephone wires at our headquarters were tapped it was evident that the administration was cognizant of every move in this procedure before it was executed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8176.mp3	no sooner was our plan decided upon than friends of the administration besought us to abandon the habeas corpus proceedings one member of the administration sent an emissary to our headquarters with the following appeal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8177.mp3	if you will only drop these proceedings i can absolutely guarantee you that the prisoners will be removed from the workhouse to the jail in a week in a week they may be dead by that time we answered we cannot wait
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8178.mp3	and before the end of the week they hoped to increase their facilities for forcible feeding at the workhouse they also wished to conceal the treatment of the women the exposure of which would be inevitable in any court proceedings and lastly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8179.mp3	the administration was anxious to avoid opening up the whole question of the legality of the very existence of the workhouse in virginia persons convicted in the district for acts committed in violation of district law were transported to virginia alien territory to serve their terms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8180.mp3	it was a moot point whether prisoners were so treated with sufficient warrant in law eminent jurists held that the district had no right to convict a person under its laws and commit that person to confinement in another state they contended that sentence imposed upon a person for unlawful acts in the district
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8181.mp3	should be executed in the district hundreds of persons who had been convicted in the district of columbia and who had served their sentences in virginia had been without money or influence enough to contest this doubtful procedure in the courts the administration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8182.mp3	was alarmed we quickened our pace a member of the administration rushed his attorney as courier to the women in the workhouse to implore them not to consent to the habeas corpus proceedings he was easily admitted and tried to extort from one prisoner at a time a promise to reject the plan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8183.mp3	the women suspected his solicitude and refused to make any promise whatsoever without first being allowed to see their own attorney we began at once to serve the writ ordinarily this would be an easy thing to do but for us it developed into a very difficult task
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8184.mp3	a deputy marshal must serve the writ counsel sought a deputy for miles around washington not one was to be found at his home or lodgings none could be reached by telephone

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8186.mp3	some had over trustful characters like the seals or exploitable characters like cows and chickens and sheep such creatures sentence themselves to be captives by their lack of ambition dogs they have more spirit

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8334.mp3	just as our political strategy had been to oppose at elections the party in power which had failed to use its power to free women so now our military strategy was based on the military doctrine of concentrating all one's forces on the enemy's weakest point
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8335.mp3	and the denial of democracy at home this was the untenable position of president wilson and the democratic administration from which we must force them to retreat we could force such a retreat when we had exposed to the world this weakest point

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8344.mp3	some rumblings of political action began to be heard the democratic majority had appointed a senate committee on woman suffrage whose members were overwhelmingly for federal action the chairman senator andreas jones of new mexico
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8345.mp3	promised an early report to the senate there were scores of gains in congress representatives and senators were tumbling over each other to introduce similar suffrage resolutions we actually had difficulty in choosing the man whose name should stamp our measure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8346.mp3	in addition to this plank they adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of democracy at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8347.mp3	and instructing the chairman of the convention to request a committee consisting of representatives of all liberal groups
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8348.mp3	they appointed a committee from the convention to carry these resolutions to the president the committee included mister j a h hopkins of the progressive party as chairman

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8351.mp3	we were not primarily interested in the amplification of congressional machinery unless this amplification was to be followed by the passage of the amendment the president could as easily have written the senate committee on suffrage or the judiciary committee of the house

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8353.mp3	and the committee of progressives understood him to have at least tacitly accepted federal action the house judiciary committee continued to refuse to act and the house rules committee steadily refused to create a suffrage committee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8354.mp3	hoping to win back to the fold the wandering progressives who had thus demonstrated their allegiance to suffrage and seeing an opportunity to embarrass the administration the republicans began to interest themselves in action on the amendment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8355.mp3	the authorization of an expenditure of ten thousand dollars for the erection of a monument to a dead president as a legitimate war measure it was clear from the partisan attitude of those who took part in the debate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8356.mp3	that we were advancing to that position where we were as good political material to be contested over by opposing political groups as was a monument to a dead president and if the democrats could defend such an issue as a war measure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8357.mp3	the administration was aroused it did not know how far the republicans were prepared to go in their drive for action so on the day of this flurry in the house the snail like rules committee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8358.mp3	and by a vote of six to five decided to report favorably on the resolution providing for a woman suffrage committee in the house after all pending war measures have been disposed of before the meeting

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8361.mp3	evidently aroused protests from powerful quarters also the republicans quickly subsided when they saw the democrats making an advance and so the democratic executive committee began to spread abroad the news that its act was not really official
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8362.mp3	but merely reflected the personal conviction of the members present it extracted the official flavor and so of course no action followed in congress and so it went like a great game of chess

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8364.mp3	behind this matching of political wits by the two parties stood the faithful pickets compelling them both to act simultaneously with these moves and counter moves in political circles the people in all sections of this vast country began to speak their minds

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8415.mp3	may safely be intrusted to the liberality of individuals who are attached to their doctrines and who find benefit or consolation from their spiritual ministry and assistance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8416.mp3	from their increasing practice study and attention but if we consider the matter more closely we shall find that this interested diligence of the clergy is what every wise legislator will study to prevent because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8417.mp3	and it has even a natural tendency to pervert the true by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition folly and delusion each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8418.mp3	will inspire them with the most violent abhorrence of all other sects and continually endeavor by some novelty to excite the languid devotion of his audience no regard will be paid to truth morals or decency in the doctrines inculcated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8419.mp3	every tenet will be adopted that best suits the disorderly affections of the human frame customers will be drawn to each conventicle by new industry and address in practising on the passions and credulity of the populace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8420.mp3	and in the end the civil magistrate will find that he has dearly paid for his pretended frugality in saving a fixed establishment for the priests and that in reality the most decent and advantageous composition which he can make with the spiritual guides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8421.mp3	is to bribe their indolence by assigning stated salaries to their profession and rendering it superfluous for them to be further active than merely to prevent their flock from straying in quest of new pastures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8422.mp3	and in this manner ecclesiastical establishments though commonly they arose at first from religious views prove in the end advantageous to the political interests of society
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8423.mp3	but we may observe that few ecclesiastical establishments have been fixed upon a worse foundation than that of the church of rome or have been attended with circumstances more hurtful to the peace and happiness of mankind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8424.mp3	the large revenues privileges immunities and powers of the clergy rendered them formidable to the civil magistrate and armed with too extensive authority an order of men who always adhere closely together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8425.mp3	the higher dignities of the church served indeed to the support of gentry and nobility but by the establishment of monasteries many of the lowest vulgar were taken from the useful arts and maintained in those receptacles of sloth and ignorance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8426.mp3	the supreme head of the church was a foreign potentate guided by interests always different from those of the community sometimes contrary to them and as the hierarchy was necessarily solicitous to preserve a unity of faith rites and ceremonies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8427.mp3	all liberty of thought ran a manifest risk of being extinguished and violent persecutions or what was worse a stupid and abject credulity took place every where to increase these evils the church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8428.mp3	though she possessed large revenues was not contented with her acquisitions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8429.mp3	she even bestowed on each individual priest a power of enriching himself by the voluntary oblations of the faithful and left him still an urgent motive for diligence and industry in his calling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8430.mp3	and thus that church though an expensive and burdensome establishment was liable to many of the inconveniences which belong to an order of priests trusting entirely to their own art and invention for obtaining a subsistence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8431.mp3	the advantages attending the romish hierarchy were but a small compensation for its inconveniences the ecclesiastical privileges during barbarous times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8432.mp3	and the pomp and splendor of worship which belonged to so opulent an establishment contributed in some respect to the encouragement of the fine arts and began to diffuse a general elegance of taste by uniting it with religion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8433.mp3	it will easily be conceived that though the balance of evil prevailed in the romish church this was not the chief reason which produced the reformation a concurrence of incidents must have contributed to forward that great revolution
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8434.mp3	in order to support his projects pleasures and liberalities the scheme of selling indulgences was suggested to him as an expedient which had often served in former times to draw money from the christian world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8435.mp3	and make devout people willing contributors to the grandeur and riches of the court of rome the church it was supposed was possessed of a great stock of merit as being entitled to all the good works of all the saints beyond what were employed in their own justification
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8436.mp3	and even to the merits of christ himself which were infinite and unbounded and from this unexhausted treasury the pope might retail particular portions and by that traffic acquire money to be employed in pious purposes in resisting the infidels

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8438.mp3	was fully acquainted with the ridicule and falsity of the doctrines which as supreme pontiff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8439.mp3	may justly in part be ascribed to the late invention of printing and revival of learning not that reason bore any considerable share in opening men's eyes with regard to the impostures of the romish church for of all branches of literature philosophy had
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8440.mp3	as yet and till long afterwards made the most inconsiderable progress neither is there any instance that argument has ever been able to free the people from that enormous load of absurdity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8441.mp3	with which superstition has every where overwhelmed them not to mention that the rapid advance of the lutheran doctrine and the violence with which it was embraced prove sufficiently that it owed not its success to reason and reflection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8442.mp3	were propagated more quickly and in greater numbers the minds of men somewhat awakened from a profound sleep of so many centuries were prepared for every novelty and scrupled less to tread in any unusual path which was opened to them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8443.mp3	and as copies of the scriptures and other ancient monuments of the christian faith became more common
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8444.mp3	many of the powers indeed assumed by the church of rome were very ancient and were prior to almost every political government established in europe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8445.mp3	which time might render valid but appealed still to a divine origin men were tempted to look into their primitive charter and they could without much difficulty perceive its defect in truth and authenticity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8446.mp3	in order to bestow on this topic the greater influence luther and his followers not satisfied with opposing the pretended divinity of the romish church and displaying the temporal inconveniences of that establishment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8447.mp3	carried matters much further and treated the religion of their ancestors as abominable detestable damnable foretold by sacred writ itself as the source of all wickedness and pollution they denominated the pope antichrist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8448.mp3	called his communion the scarlet whore and gave to rome the appellation of babylon expressions which however applied were to be found in scripture and which were better calculated to operate on the multitude than the most solid arguments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8449.mp3	excited by contest and persecution on the one hand by success and applause on the other many of the reformers carried to the greatest extremities their opposition to the church of rome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8450.mp3	and in contradiction to the multiplied superstitions with which that communion was loaded they adopted an enthusiastic strain of devotion which admitted of no observances rites or ceremonies but placed all merit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8451.mp3	in a mysterious species of faith in inward vision rapture and ecstasy the new sectaries seized with this spirit were indefatigable in the propagation of their doctrine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8452.mp3	against the ecclesiastical jurisdiction the lutherans advanced doctrines favorable in some respect to the temporal authority of sovereigns they inveighed against the abuses of the court of rome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8453.mp3	in those powers of which the encroaching spirit of the ecclesiastics especially of the sovereign pontiff had so long bereaved them they condemned celibacy and monastic vows and thereby opened the doors of the convents

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8459.mp3	and by this sincere avowal he gave occasion of much triumph to the lutherans this pontiff also whose penetration was not equal to his good intentions was seduced to concur in that league which charles and henry had formed against france
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8460.mp3	and who dreaded the resentment of that haughty minister was solicitous to repair the breach made in their friendship by this incident

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8466.mp3	felt that her very life was slipping away as if when that voice drew nearer when that singer became entrapped she distinctly heard the click of desgas gun close to her no no no no oh god in heaven this cannot be

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8471.mp3	the very cliffs echoed the poor heart broken woman's screams chauvelin with a muttered oath which boded no good to her who had dared to upset his most cherished plans had hastily shouted the word of command into it my men and let no one escape from that hut alive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8472.mp3	the moon had once more emerged from between the clouds the darkness on the cliffs had gone giving place once more to brilliant silvery light some of the soldiers had rushed to the rough wooden door of the hut whilst one of them kept guard over marguerite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8473.mp3	the door was partially open one of the soldiers pushed it further but within all was darkness the charcoal fire only lighting with a dim red light the furthest corner of the hut the soldiers paused automatically at the door like machines waiting for further orders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8474.mp3	was for the moment paralyzed with astonishment when he saw the soldiers standing there at attention like sentries on guard whilst not a sound proceeded from the hut filled with strange anxious foreboding he too went to the door of the hut and peering into the gloom he asked quickly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8475.mp3	what is the meaning of this i think citoyen that there is no one there now replied one of the soldiers imperturbably you have not let those four men go thundered chauvelin menacingly i ordered you to let no man escape alive quick after them all of you quick in every direction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8476.mp3	the men obedient as machines rushed down the rocky incline towards the beach some going off to right and left as fast as their feet could carry them you and your men will pay with your lives for this blunder citoyen sergeant said chauvelin viciously to the sergeant who had been in charge of the men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8477.mp3	and you too citoyen he added turning with a snarl to desgas for disobeying my orders you ordered us to wait citoyen until the tall englishman arrived and joined the four men in the hut no one came said the sergeant sullenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8478.mp3	but i ordered you just now when the woman screamed to rush in and let no one escape but citoyen the four men who were there before had been gone some time i think you think you said chauvelin almost choking with fury and you let them go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8479.mp3	you ordered us to wait citoyen protested the sergeant and to implicitly obey your commands on pain of death we waited
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8480.mp3	which way did they go asked chauvelin i could not tell citoyen said the sergeant they went straight down the cliff first then disappeared behind some boulders hush what was that all three men listened attentively
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8481.mp3	in the far very far distance could be heard faintly echoing and already dying away the quick sharp splash of half a dozen oars chauvelin took out his handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his forehead the schooner's boat was all he gasped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8482.mp3	evidently armand saint just and his three companions had managed to creep along the side of the cliffs whilst the men like true soldiers of the well drilled republican army had with blind obedience and in fear of their own lives implicitly obeyed chauvelin's orders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8483.mp3	to wait for the tall englishman who was the important capture they had no doubt reached one of the creeks which jut far out to sea on this coast at intervals behind this the boat of the day dream must have been on the lookout for them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8484.mp3	it needed all chauvelin's nerve and presence of mind not to give way to a useless and undignified access of rage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8485.mp3	how he had contrived to reach the hut without being seen by one of the thirty soldiers who guarded the spot was more than chauvelin could conceive that he had done so before the thirty men had arrived on the cliff was of course fairly clear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8486.mp3	there were no fairies and hobgoblins about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8487.mp3	by that time the four fugitives must have reached the creek and got into the boat and the nearest creek was more than a mile from the hut where had that daring singer got to unless satan himself had lent him wings he could not have covered that mile on a rocky cliff in the space of two minutes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8488.mp3	one or two of the men who had run after the fugitives were now slowly working their way up the cliff one of them reached chauvelin's side at the very moment that this hope arose in the astute diplomatist's heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8489.mp3	we were too late citoyen the soldier said we reached the beach just before the moon was hidden by that bank of clouds the boat had undoubtedly been on the look out behind that first creek a mile off but she had shoved off some time ago when we got to the beach and was already some way out to sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8490.mp3	yes said chauvelin with eager impatience she had shoved off some time ago you said and the nearest creek is a mile further on yes citoyen i ran all the way straight to the beach though i guessed the boat would have waited somewhere near the creek as the tide would reach there earliest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8491.mp3	with a rapid glance chauvelin noted its contents the cauldron placed close under an aperture in the wall and containing the last few dying embers of burned charcoal a couple of stools overturned as if in the haste of sudden departure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8492.mp3	then the fisherman's tools and his nets lying in one corner and beside them something small and white pick that up said chauvelin to the sergeant pointing to this white scrap and bring it to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8493.mp3	it was a crumpled piece of paper evidently forgotten there by the fugitives in their hurry to get away the sergeant much awed by the citoyen's obvious rage and impatience picked the paper up and handed it respectfully to chauvelin read it sergeant said the latter curtly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8494.mp3	it is almost illegible citoyen a fearful scrawl i ordered you to read it repeated chauvelin viciously the sergeant by the light of his lantern began deciphering the few hastily scrawled words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8495.mp3	i cannot quite reach you without risking your lives and endangering the success of your rescue when you receive this wait two minutes then creep out of the hut one by one turn to your left sharply and creep cautiously down the cliff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8496.mp3	i shall be there as soon as possible they must wait for me at a safe distance out at sea till they hear the usual signal do not delay and obey these instructions implicitly then there is the signature citoyen added the sergeant as he handed the paper back to chauvelin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8497.mp3	but the latter had not waited an instant one phrase of the momentous scrawl had caught his ear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8498.mp3	that phrase might yet mean victory for him which of you knows this coast well he shouted to his men who now one by one all returned from their fruitless run and were all assembled once more round the hut
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8499.mp3	there is citoyen i know it well the englishman is hoping to reach that creek
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8500.mp3	at any rate there is a chance to get him yet a thousand francs to each man who gets to that creek before that long legged englishman i know of a short cut across the cliffs said the soldier and with an enthusiastic shout he rushed forward followed closely by his comrades
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8501.mp3	within a few minutes their running footsteps had died away in the distance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8502.mp3	his well laid plan had failed its sequel was problematical there was still a great chance now that the scarlet pimpernel might yet escape and chauvelin with that unreasoning fury which sometimes assails a strong nature was longing to vent his rage on somebody
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8503.mp3	the soldiers were holding marguerite pinioned to the ground though she poor soul was not making the faintest struggle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8504.mp3	her eyes circled by deep purple lines that told of long sleepless nights her hair matted and damp round her forehead her lips parted in a sharp curve that spoke of physical pain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8505.mp3	but the hard vengeful heart of her baffled enemy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8506.mp3	obediently the soldiers rose to their feet you'd better try and find that footpath again for me and that broken down cart we left on the road then suddenly a bright idea seemed to strike him ah by the bye where is the jew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8507.mp3	i gagged him and tied his legs together as you commanded from the immediate vicinity a plaintive moan reached chauvelin's ears he followed his secretary who led the way to the other side of the hut
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8508.mp3	where fallen into an absolute heap of dejection with his legs tightly pinioned together and his mouth gagged lay the unfortunate descendant of israel his face in the silvery light of the moon looked positively ghastly with terror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8509.mp3	while a piteous wail escaped his bloodless lips the rope which had originally been wound round his shoulders and arms had evidently given way for it lay in a tangle about his body
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8510.mp3	like a terrified chicken which looks upon a line of white chalk drawn on a table as on a string which paralyzes its movements bring the cowardly brute here commanded chauvelin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8511.mp3	he certainly felt exceedingly vicious and since he had no reasonable grounds for venting his ill humour on the soldiers who had but too punctually obeyed his orders he felt that the son of the despised race would prove an excellent butt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8512.mp3	with true french contempt of the jew which has survived the lapse of centuries even to this day he would not go too near him but said with biting sarcasm as the wretched old man was brought in full light of the moon by the two soldiers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8513.mp3	i suppose now that being a jew you have a good memory for bargains answer he again commanded as the jew with trembling lips seemed too frightened to speak yes your honour stammered the poor wretch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8514.mp3	b but your honour there is no but i said do you remember
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8515.mp3	your honour he ventured imploringly since your terror seems to have paralyzed your tongue said chauvelin sarcastically i must needs refresh your memory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8516.mp3	it was agreed between us that if we overtook my friend the tall stranger before he reached this place you were to have ten pieces of gold a low moan escaped from the jew's trembling lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8517.mp3	but added chauvelin with slow emphasis if you deceived me in your promise you were to have a sound beating one that would teach you not to tell lies i did not your honour i swear it by abraham
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8518.mp3	and by all the other patriarchs i know unfortunately they are still in hades i believe according to your creed and cannot help you much in your present trouble now you did not fulfil your share of the bargain but i am ready to fulfil mine here he added turning to the soldiers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8519.mp3	i think i can rely on you citoyen soldiers laughed chauvelin maliciously to give this old liar the best and soundest beating he has ever experienced but don't kill him he added drily we will obey citoyen replied the soldiers as imperturbably as ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8520.mp3	he did not wait to see his orders carried out he knew that he could trust these soldiers who were still smarting under his rebuke not to mince matters when given a free hand to belabour a third party
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8521.mp3	the jew and the woman can look after each other he added roughly until we can send somebody for them in the morning they can't run away very far in their present condition and we cannot be troubled with them just now chauvelin had not given up all hope his men he knew were spurred on by the hope of the reward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8522.mp3	but he felt less sure now the englishman's audacity had baffled him once whilst the wooden headed stupidity of the soldiers and the interference of a woman had turned his hand which held all the trumps into a losing one

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8670.mp3	and gradually narrowed to two points below sometimes as shown in many ancient figures it falls down in a single mass while in a few it is cut straight across at bottom not unlike assyrian beards nearly all have a mustache

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8674.mp3	and baths and the use of baths are constantly mentioned in the old tales and other writings in every public hostel in every monastery and in every high class house there was a bath with its accompaniments soap was used both in bathing and washing

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8677.mp3	in this respect they resembled many other nations of antiquity as well indeed as of the present day and they illustrated ruskin's saying

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8683.mp3	but it was much shorter and without a collar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8684.mp3	a short cape was often worn on the shoulders sometimes carrying a hood to cover the head the outer covering of the general run of the peasantry was just one loose sleeved coat or mantle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8685.mp3	which covered them down to the ankles and which they wore winter and summer women commonly wore a long loose cloak with a hood a fashion which is common at the present day the over garments were fastened by brooches pins buttons

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8687.mp3	like other irish garments it was generally striped or speckled in various colours leggings of cloth or of thin soft leather were used and were laced on by strings tipped with white bronze
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8688.mp3	a kilt was often worn in which case the legs were left bare at the knees with leggings below for the kilt is of irish origin and was brought like many other fashions by the early colonists to scotland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8689.mp3	and when not actually worn was usually carried among other small articles in a lady's ornamental hand bag shoes were often made of untanned hide stitched with thongs with several layers for a sole but there was a more shapely shoe made of fully tanned leather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8690.mp3	having serviceable sole and heel and often ornamented with patterns stamped in the irish were excessively fond of personal ornaments which among the higher classes were made of expensive materials such as gold silver gems white bronze et cetera
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8691.mp3	they wore rings and bracelets of various shapes on the fingers including the thumb round the wrist and forearm and even round the leg above the ankle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8692.mp3	all of which materials were found native they had torques for the neck made of twisted gold bars and the elaborate and immensely expensive crescents or gorgets

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8698.mp3	this little book has been written and published with the main object of spreading as widely as possible among our people young and old a knowledge of the civilisation and general social condition of ireland from the fifth or sixth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8699.mp3	when it was wholly governed by native rulers the publication comes at an appropriate time when there is an awakening of interest in the irish language and in irish lore of every kind unparalleled in our history but the book has a further mission
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8700.mp3	there are many english and many anglo irish people who think merely from ignorance that ireland was a barbarous and half savage country before the english came among the people and civilised them this book so far as it finds its way among the two classes above mentioned will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8701.mp3	i fancy open their eyes they will learn from it that the old irish so far from being barbarous were a bright intellectual and cultured people that they had professions trades and industries pervading the whole population
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8702.mp3	with clearly defined ranks and grades of society all working under an elaborate system of native laws and that in the steadying and civilising arts and pursuits of everyday life they were as well advanced as orderly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8703.mp3	and as regular as any other european people of the same period they will find too that as regards education scholarship and general mental culture the irish of those early ages were in advance of all other countries of europe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8704.mp3	that they helped most materially to spread christianity and to revive learning all over the continent and that to irish missionaries and scholars the anglo saxons of the heptarchy were indebted for the greater part of their christianity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8705.mp3	and for the preservation and restoration of learning when it was threatened with extinction all over england by the ravages of the danes but there were and are englishmen better informed about our country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8706.mp3	more than three hundred years ago the great english poet edmund spenser lived for some time in ireland and made himself well acquainted with its history he knew what it was in past ages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8707.mp3	of wealth and goodnesse far above the rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8708.mp3	but it is better not to pursue these observations farther here as it would be only anticipating what will be found in the body of the book this book is the last of a series of three of which the second is abridged from the first and the third from both
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8709.mp3	the first a social history of ancient ireland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8710.mp3	contains a complete survey of the social life and institutions of ancient ireland all the important statements in it are proved home by references to authorities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8711.mp3	the second a smaller social history of ancient ireland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8712.mp3	five hundred ninety eight pages in twenty seven chapters with two hundred thirteen illustrations traverses the same ground as the larger work but besides condensation most of the illustrative quotations and nearly all the references to authorities are omitted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8713.mp3	this third book the story of ancient irish civilisation gives in simple plain language an account of the condition of the country in the olden time but as it is here to speak for itself i need not describe it further
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8714.mp3	for all the statements it contains full and satisfactory authorities will be found in the two larger works i have done my best to make all three readable and interesting as well as instructive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8715.mp3	the ordinary history of our country has been written by many and the reader has a wide choice but in the matter of our social history he has no choice at all for these three books of mine have for the first and only time

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8718.mp3	and take heed also to thyself and thine own kingdom if thou permit this new fashion of driving forth kings to go unpunished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8719.mp3	that in freedom which men greatly desire and if they that be kings defend not their dignity as stoutly as others seek to overthrow it then shall the highest be made even as the lowest and there shall be an end of kingship than which there is nothing more honorable under heaven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8720.mp3	with these words they persuaded king porsenna who judging it well for the etrurians that there should be a king at rome and that king an etrurian by birth gathered together a great army and came up against rome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8721.mp3	but when men heard of his coming so mighty a city was clusium in those days and so great the fame of king porsenna
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8722.mp3	in the meanwhile i so far as one man may do will stay the enemy and as he spake he ran forward to the farther end of the bridge and made ready to keep the way against the enemy nevertheless there stood two with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8723.mp3	lartius and herminius by name men of noble birth both of them and of great renown in arms so these three for a while stayed the first onset of the enemy and the men of rome meanwhile brake down the bridge and when there was but a small part remaining
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8724.mp3	and they that brake it down called to the three that they should come back horatius bade lartius and herminius return but he himself remained on the farther side turning his eyes full of wrath in threatening fashion on the princes of the etrurians and crying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8725.mp3	king porsenna to rob others of the freedom that ye care not to have for yourselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8726.mp3	looking each man to his neighbor who should first deal with this champion of the romans then for very shame they all ran forward and raising a great shout threw their javelins at him these all he took upon his shield nor stood the less firmly in his place on the bridge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8727.mp3	for the bridge was now altogether broken down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8728.mp3	and as the enemy stayed a while for fear horatius turned him to the river and said o father tiber i beseech thee this day with all reverence that thou kindly receive this soldier and his arms and as he spake he leapt with all his arms into the river
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8729.mp3	and swam across to his own people and though many javelins of the enemy fell about him he was not one whit hurt nor did such valor fail to receive due honor from the city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8730.mp3	morley paused as he recognised egremont then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mister hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8731.mp3	perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8732.mp3	and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8733.mp3	and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to sybil she beheld him with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8734.mp3	and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8735.mp3	that appearance was prepossessing a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8736.mp3	detract from the favourable effect that he always at once produced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8737.mp3	is the privilege of the people of whom i am one said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labour their labour said sybil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8738.mp3	is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8739.mp3	then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew i was with him more than an hour continued morley at first he recollected nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8740.mp3	he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8741.mp3	this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8742.mp3	he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8743.mp3	he would propose that i should at once accompany him i thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8744.mp3	you did well good stephen as you always do said sybil with a musing and abstracted air no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8745.mp3	hers were kind and calm and this egremont said morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8746.mp3	the mystification of which we had been dupes and you did wrong said sybil there is no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here today he met and addressed me and i only recognised an acquaintance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8747.mp3	had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8748.mp3	you are right said morley looking at her rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said sybil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8749.mp3	he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8750.mp3	and yet if anything were to happen to morrow said morley rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8751.mp3	the factions become united sybil turned and looked at him and then said and what could happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8752.mp3	you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not what then is there to fear and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morley and all may continue well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8753.mp3	but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits sybil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it does not much suit me i am a man of the closet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8754.mp3	morley shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are always easy the fact is in active life one cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8755.mp3	lawfully meeting in open day and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavoured to degrade them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8756.mp3	there can be other than one and the same object a thousand said morley we have already as many parties as in saint stephen's itself you terrify me said sybil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8757.mp3	my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believed that we had on our side god and truth they know neither of them in the national convention said morley

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8815.mp3	since the night before he had been rankling under a sense of youth was i pretty awful last night he asked you were very interesting and i imagine rather indiscreet

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8818.mp3	encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8819.mp3	her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely she knew every move of the game she was determining to play marion hayden at twenty five knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8823.mp3	they met there smoked her cigarets made love in a corner occasionally became engaged but she was of the game no longer in it men still came to see her a growing percentage of them married

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8825.mp3	but more and more her dinner invitations were from the older crowd like natalie spencer's stupid party the night before so she watched graham and listened he was a nice boy and a handsome one

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8836.mp3	and if we have you won't go promise me you won't go when he hesitated she resorted to her old methods with both clayton and the boy she was doing all she could to make them happy she made no demands none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8837.mp3	but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her it was refused of course she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money and this was the gratitude she received graham listened

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8841.mp3	at the sound of a howl outside the palace listen to that tiger remarked the king tiger replied the queen how should there be a tiger inside the city it was only a jackal i tell you it was a tiger said the king and i tell you that you were dreaming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8842.mp3	if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen i say it was a tiger cried the king don't contradict me nonsense snapped the queen it was a jackal and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said at last very well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8843.mp3	we'll call the guard and ask and if it was a jackal i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away and if it was a tiger then you shall go and i will marry a new wife as you like answered the queen there isn't any doubt which it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8844.mp3	so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question to them but whilst the dispute was going on the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said and one man observed to the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8845.mp3	mind you declare that the king is right it certainly was a jackal but if we say so the king will probably not keep his word about going away and we shall get into trouble so we had better take his side to this the other agreed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8846.mp3	the king made no remark but sent for a palanquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it bidding the four bearers of the palanquin to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave her in spite of her tears she was forced to obey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8847.mp3	and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8848.mp3	and started home again now the queen thought to herself that the king could not mean to send her away for good and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back so she stayed quite still for a long time listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8849.mp3	but heard none after a while she grew nervous for she was all alone and put her head out of the palanquin and looked about her day was just breaking and birds and insects were beginning to stir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8850.mp3	but although the queen's eyes wandered in all directions there was no sign of any human being then her spirit gave way and she began to cry it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8851.mp3	where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbours as it was hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house but was awakened by the sound of weeping he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could and into the forest towards the place the sound came from
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8852.mp3	and when she had told her story the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on and in the farm a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named ameer ali
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8853.mp3	years passed without a sign from the king his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care though the queen still lived with the farmer and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong handsome and healthy youth out in the forest they seemed far from the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8854.mp3	very few ever came near them and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his own living but she and the wise farmer always counselled him to wait until

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8858.mp3	presently as he made his way through a thicket he saw a pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner so he fired a pellet at it from his galail but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter at the same instant he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8859.mp3	and on reaching the spot he found an ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8860.mp3	the old woman's face brightened she showed him where to seek the water and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim she led the way without a word and he followed in a short while they came to a hut in the forest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8861.mp3	and as they drew near it ameer ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on at the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut and much as he wished to see her again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8862.mp3	ameer ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back and so with a heavy heart he made his salutation and bade the old woman farewell but when he had gone a little way she called after him if ever you are in trouble or danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8863.mp3	come to where you now stand and cry fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me now and i will listen to you the prince thanked her and continued his journey but he thought little of the old woman's saying and much of the lovely damsel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8864.mp3	shortly afterwards he arrived at a city and as he was now in great straits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8865.mp3	the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8866.mp3	and promised that he should enter his bodyguard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous this was just what ameer ali wanted and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8867.mp3	soon after this on a dark and stormy night when the river roared beneath the palace walls the sound of a woman weeping and wailing was heard above the storm the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter but the servant falling on his knees in terror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8868.mp3	begged that he might not be sent on such an errand particularly on a night so wild when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad indeed so frightened was he that the king who was very kind hearted bade another to go in his stead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8869.mp3	but each one showed the same strange fear then ameer ali stepped forward this is my duty your majesty he said i will go the king nodded and off he went the night was as dark as pitch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8870.mp3	but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water inch by inch and foot by foot he fought his way across now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy now narrowly escaping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8871.mp3	being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream at length he emerged panting and dripping wet on the other side close by the bank stood a gallows and on the gallows hung the body of some evildoer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8872.mp3	whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8873.mp3	or of the roaring river as for ghosts and witches they had never troubled him so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of the woman what ails you he said now the woman was not really a woman at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8874.mp3	but a horrid kind of witch who really lived in witchland and had no business on earth if ever a man strayed into witchland the ogresses used to eat him up and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8875.mp3	in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue so when ameer ali questioned her she replied ah kind sir it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows help me to get him down and i will bless you for ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8876.mp3	ameer ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8877.mp3	and bent so that the old woman could clamber on to his back which she did very nimbly then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8878.mp3	but ameer ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8879.mp3	and with a yell of pain and anger she vanished into the darkness ameer ali then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8880.mp3	and as the storm had by this time passed over he made his way back to the palace when he had finished his story he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed it to the king who like everyone else was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8881.mp3	ameer ali himself was astonished for he had slipped the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since the king was delighted at its beauty and having praised and rewarded ameer ali he gave the anklet to his daughter a proud and spoiled princess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8882.mp3	now in the women's apartments in the palace there hung two cages in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling and these two birds could talk as well as human beings they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8883.mp3	walking grandly about with her treasure tied round her ankle she heard the starling say to the parrot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8884.mp3	that was the parrot's name how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel think snapped the parrot who was cross because they hadn't given him his bath that morning i think she looks like a washerwoman's daughter with one shoe on and the other off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8885.mp3	why doesn't she wear two of them instead of going about with one leg adorned and the other empty when the princess heard this she burst into tears and sending for her father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8886.mp3	or she would die of shame so the king sent for ameer ali
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8887.mp3	or he should be hanged for the princess would certainly die of disappointment poor ameer ali was greatly troubled at the king's command but he thought to himself that he had at any rate a month in which to lay his plans he left the palace at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8888.mp3	and inquired of everyone where the finest jewels were to be got but though he sought night and day he never found one to compare with the anklet at last only a week remained and he was in sore difficulty when he remembered the fairy of the forest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8889.mp3	therefore away he went and after a day's travelling he reached the cottage in the forest and standing where he had stood when the old woman called to him he cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me help me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8890.mp3	then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had seen before whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten what is the matter she asked in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8891.mp3	then he told her his story and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart and then turning to him she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8892.mp3	and hold it over the cauldron and every drop of blood that falls from it into the water will become a jewel next you must change the wands so that the one that stood at my head is at my feet and the one at my feet stands at my head and place the severed foot against the wound and it will heal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8893.mp3	and i shall become quite well again as before at first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8894.mp3	at length she persuaded him to do her bidding he nearly fainted himself with horror when he found that after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off she lay as one lifeless but he held the severed foot over the cauldron and as drops of blood fell from it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8895.mp3	and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems his heart took courage very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron and he quickly changed the wands placed the severed foot against the wound and immediately the two parts became one as before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8896.mp3	then the maiden opened her eyes sprang to her feet and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut and would not come out or speak to him any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8897.mp3	but three rare and beautiful anklets and these he duly presented to the king on the very day that his month of grace was over the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts and the next day the vain princess put two anklets on each foot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8898.mp3	and strutted up and down in them admiring herself in the mirrors that lined her room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8899.mp3	and never recovered his temper until after lunch she's got all her beauty at one end of her now if she had a few of those fine gew gaws round her neck and wrists she would look better but now to my mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8900.mp3	she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up poor princess she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8901.mp3	and then she declared to her father that unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die again the king sent for ameer ali and ordered him to get a necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month or be put to a cruel death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8902.mp3	and again ameer ali spent nearly the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8903.mp3	once more the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8904.mp3	and her head her words turned ameer ali pale with horror but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before and at last he consented to do as she bade him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8905.mp3	from her severed hands and head there fell into the cauldron bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8906.mp3	then the head and hands were joined on to the body and left neither sign nor scar full of gratitude ameer ali tried to speak to her but she ran into the house and would not come back and he was forced to leave her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8907.mp3	when on the day appointed ameer ali produced a necklace and bracelets each more beautiful and priceless than the last the king's astonishment knew no bounds and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8908.mp3	the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with her appearance and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8909.mp3	how do you think our princess is looking now very fine no doubt grumbled the parrot but what is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only she ought to have a husband why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8910.mp3	then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry ameer ali
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8911.mp3	so the king sent for ameer ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honour of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to the throne on hearing this speech
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8912.mp3	ameer ali bowed low and answered that he had done and would do the king all the service that lay in his power save only this one thing the king who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man flew into a passion and the princess was more furious still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8913.mp3	ameer ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find and ordered to be kept there until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death meanwhile the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8914.mp3	so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighbouring countries proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and heir to the throne should present himself at the palace when the day came all the court were gathered together and a great crowd assembled of men young and old
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8915.mp3	who thought that they had as good a chance as anyone else to gain both the throne and the princess as soon as the king was seated he called upon an usher to summon the first claimant but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8916.mp3	well hasten then said the king i have no time to waste your majesty said the farmer has now lived and administered justice long in this city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8917.mp3	whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something to be picked up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8918.mp3	no your majesty answered the farmer i would only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals gathered to day to try and claim your daughter and kingdom every city has sent them and they wait hungry and eager but do not o king mistake or pretend again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8919.mp3	to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger the king turned first red and then pale there is continued the farmer a royal tiger bred in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your throne where
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8920.mp3	growing pale as he listened in prison replied the farmer if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals i will explain clear the court commanded the king and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8921.mp3	then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up ameer ali and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside at the sight of her the king was filled with shame and self reproach and wished he could have lived his life over again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8922.mp3	and not have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death my day is past said he and he gave up his crown to his son ameer ali who went once more and called to the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his throne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8923.mp3	there is only one person i will marry said he and this time the maiden did not run away but agreed to be his wife so the two were married without delay and lived long and reigned happily as for the old woman whose pitcher ameer ali had broken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8924.mp3	she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl she gladly returned to fairyland the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife any more if he even looks as if he does not agree with her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8925.mp3	she smiles at him and says is it the tiger then or the jackal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8926.mp3	after a long and tedious discourse of these six non natural things and their several rectifications
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8927.mp3	or that kind of physic which cureth by medicines which apothecaries most part make mingle or sell in their shops many cavil at this kind of physic and hold it unnecessary unprofitable to this or any other disease

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8959.mp3	the contrary is true what we need is not less education but more more trained leaders to uphold the standards of civilization before both races among indian college and university graduates a failure is very rare
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8960.mp3	i am sure i have not met one and really do not know of one the press is responsible for many popular errors whenever an indian indulges in any notorious misbehavior he is widely heralded as a carlisle graduate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8961.mp3	although because of the wonderful athletic prowess of its students they have met and defeated the athletes of many a white university on the football field

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8963.mp3	it will be seen then that the college educated men and women of my race have accomplished quite a feat considering their antecedents and wholly foreign point of view they have had to adjust themselves to a new way of thinking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8964.mp3	furthermore they are almost always hampered by lack of means nevertheless an increasing number have succeeded in the undertaking trials of the educated indian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8965.mp3	i wish to contradict the popular misconception that an educated indian will necessarily meet with strong prejudice among his own people or will be educated out of sympathy with them from their point of view
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8966.mp3	a particularly able or well equipped man of their race is a public blessing and all but public property that was the old rule among us up to a very recent period an educated indian could not succeed materially
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8967.mp3	he could not better himself because the people required him to give unlimited free service according to the old regime i have even known one to be killed by the continual demands upon him there was a time not so long ago either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8968.mp3	when the educated indian stood in a very uncomfortable position between his people and the government officials and shady politicians every complaint was brought to him as a matter of course and he was expected to expose and redress every wrong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8969.mp3	as i have said elsewhere such efforts are generally useless and resulted only in damage to his financial position and his reputation no doubt he often invited attacks upon himself by a rashness born of his ardent sympathy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8970.mp3	for his fellow tribesmen in this matter i speak from personal experience as well as long observation even in the old wild days an education was appreciated by the indians
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8971.mp3	but it was a hard life for the educated man they made him carry too heavy a burden without much recompense save honor and respect but we have pretty well passed through that period and the native graduates of our higher institutions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8972.mp3	have begun to show their strength and enlarge their views they have not only done well for themselves and their race but they stand before the world as living illustrations of its capacity disproving many theories concerning untutored races
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8973.mp3	no inferior race it was declared without qualification by the universal races congress at london in nineteen eleven that there is no inherently superior race
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8974.mp3	therefore no inferior race from every race some individuals have mastered the same curriculum and passed the same tests and in some instances members of so called uncivilized races
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8975.mp3	because of the racial environment change the environment and the race is transformed certainly the american indian has clearly demonstrated the truth of this assertion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8976.mp3	the very mention of the name indian in earlier days would make the average white man's blood creep with thoughts of the war whoop and the scalping knife

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/8978.mp3	it is a fact that the intelligent and educated indian has no social prejudice to contend with his color is not counted against him he is received cordially and upon equal terms in school college and society

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9349.mp3	john merrick was sixty years old but as hale and rugged as a boy of twenty he had made his vast fortune on the pacific coast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9350.mp3	who never had credited him with sufficient ability to earn more than a precarious livelihood but the man was shrewd enough in a business way although simple almost to childishness in many other matters when he returned quite unheralded to end his days at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9351.mp3	and employ his ample wealth to the best advantage he for a time kept his success a secret and so learned much of the dispositions and personal characteristics of his three nieces they were at that time visiting his unmarried sister jane at her estate at elmhurst
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9352.mp3	and in the race for aunt jane's fortune he watched the three girls carefully and found much to admire in each one of them patsy doyle however proved exceptionally frank and genuine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9353.mp3	patsy proved the one bright star in the firmament of disappointment supposing uncle john to be poor she insisted upon carrying him to new york with her and sharing with him the humble tenement room in which she lived with her father a retired veteran who helped pay the family expenses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9354.mp3	by keeping books for a mercantile firm while patsy worked in a hair dresser's shop it was now that uncle john proved a modern fairy godfather to aunt jane's nieces who were likewise his own nieces the three girls had little in common except their poverty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9355.mp3	elizabeth de graf being the daughter of a music teacher in cloverton ohio while louise merrick lived with her widowed mother in a social atmosphere of the second class in new york
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9356.mp3	where the two women frankly intrigued to ensnare for louise a husband who had sufficient means to ensure both mother and daughter a comfortable home in spite of this worldly and unlovely ambition which their circumstances might partially excuse louise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9357.mp3	who was but seventeen had many good and womanly qualities could they have been developed in an atmosphere uninfluenced by the schemes of her vain and selfish mother uncle john casting aside the mask of poverty came to the relief of all three girls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9358.mp3	he settled the incomes of substantial sums of money upon both beth and louise making them practically independent for patsy he bought a handsome modern flat building located at thirty seven o eight willing square
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9359.mp3	and installed her and the major in its cosiest apartment the rents of the remaining flats giving the doyles an adequate income for all time to come here uncle john believing himself cordially welcome as indeed he was made his own home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9360.mp3	and it required no shrewd guessing to arrive at the conclusion that little patsy was destined to inherit some day all his millions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9361.mp3	had long managed successfully john merrick's vast fortune and at his solicitation it gave major doyle a responsible position in its main office with a salary that rendered him independent of his daughter's suddenly acquired wealth and made him proud and self respecting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9362.mp3	money had no power to change the nature of the doyles the major remained the same simple honest courteous yet brusque old warrior who had won uncle john's love as a hard working book keeper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9363.mp3	and patsy's bright and sunny disposition had certain power to cheer any home whether located in a palace or a hovel never before in his life had uncle john been so supremely happy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9364.mp3	and never before had aunt jane's three nieces had so many advantages and pleasures it was to confer still further benefits upon these girls that their eccentric uncle had planned this unexpected european trip his telegram to elizabeth was characteristic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9365.mp3	patsy louise and i sail for europe next tuesday will you join us as my guest if so take first train to new york where i will look after your outfit answer immediately that was a message likely to surprise a country girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9366.mp3	but it did not strike john merrick as in any way extraordinary he thought he could depend upon beth she would be as eager to go as he was to have her and when he had paid for the telegram he dismissed the matter from further thought next morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9367.mp3	patsy reminded him that instead of going down town he must personally notify louise merrick of the proposed trip so he took a cross town line and arrived at the merrick's home at nine o'clock missus merrick was in a morning wrapper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9368.mp3	sipping her coffee in an upper room but she could not deny herself to uncle john her dead husband's brother and her only daughter's benefactor which meant indirectly her own benefactor so she ordered the maid to show him up at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9369.mp3	louise is still sweetly sleeping she said and won't waken for hours yet is anything wrong with her he asked anxiously oh dear no but everyone does not get up with the milkman as you do john
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9370.mp3	and the dear child was at the opera last night which made her late in getting home doesn't the opera let out before midnight the same as the theatres he asked i believe so but there is the supper afterward you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9371.mp3	ah yes he returned thoughtfully i've always noticed that the opera makes folks desperately hungry for they flock to the restaurants as soon as they can get away singular isn't it why i never thought of it in that light
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9372.mp3	but louise is well quite well thank you that's a great relief for i'm going to take her to europe with me next week he said missus merrick was so astonished that she nearly dropped her coffee cup
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9373.mp3	and could make no better reply than to stare blankly at her brother in law we sail tuesday continued uncle john and you must have my niece ready in time and deliver her on board the princess irene at hoboken at nine o'clock sharp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9374.mp3	it will take a month at least to make her gowns and stuff and rubbish he growled that shows martha how little you know about european trips no one makes gowns to go abroad with you buy em in paris to bring home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9375.mp3	ah yes to be sure she muttered perhaps then it can be done if louise has no other engagements just what patsy said see here martha do you imagine that any girl who is half human could have engagements that would keep her from europe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9376.mp3	but the requirements of society you'll get me riled pretty soon martha and if you do you'll wish you hadn't this speech frightened the woman it wouldn't do to provoke uncle john however unreasonable he happened to be so she said meekly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9377.mp3	i've no doubt louise will be delighted to go and so will i you why why whom do you intend taking just the three girls aunt jane's three nieces also mine but you'll want a chaperone for them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9378.mp3	why so propriety requires it and so does ordinary prudence louise i know will be discreet for it is her nature but patsy is such a little flyaway
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9379.mp3	uncle john grew red and his eyes flashed a chaperone he cried contemptuously not any in mine martha merrick either we young folks go alone without any death's head to perpetually glower at us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9380.mp3	three better girls never lived and i'll trust em anywhere besides that we aren't going to any of your confounded social functions we're going on a reg'lar picnic and if i don't give those girls the time of their lives my name ain't john merrick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9381.mp3	a chaperone indeed missus merrick held up her hands in horror i'm not sure john she gasped that i ought to trust my dear child with an uncle who disregards so openly the proprieties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9382.mp3	well i'm sure and the thing's settled he said more calmly don't worry ma'am i'll look after patsy and beth and louise will look after all of us just as she does after you because she's so discreet talk about your being a chaperone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9383.mp3	why you don't dare say your soul's your own when louise is awake that chaperone business is all humbuggery unless an old uncle like me can be a chaperone anyhow i'm the only one that's going to be appointed i won't wait for louise to wake up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9384.mp3	just tell her the news and help her to get ready on time and now i'm off good morning martha she really had no words of protest ready at hand and it was long after queer old john merrick had gone away that she remembered a dozen effective speeches that she might have delivered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9385.mp3	after all she sighed taking up her cup again it may be the best thing in the world for louise we don't know whether that young weldon who is paying her attentions just now is going to inherit his father's money or not he's been a bit wild i've heard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9386.mp3	and it is just as well to postpone any engagement until we find out the facts i can do that nicely while my sweet child is in europe with uncle john and away from all danger of entanglements
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9387.mp3	the adventure of the cart it befell in the month of may queen guenever called to her knights of the table round and gave them warning that early upon the morrow she would ride a maying into the woods and fields beside westminster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9388.mp3	and i warn you that there be none of you but he be well horsed and that ye all be clothed in green either silk or cloth and i shall bring with me ten ladies and every knight shall have a lady behind him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9389.mp3	and every knight shall have a squire and two yeoman and all well horsed for thus it chanced one morn when all the court green suited but with plumes that mock'd the may had been their wont a maying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9390.mp3	so they made them ready and these were the names of the knights sir kay the seneschal sir agrivaine sir brandiles sir sagramour le desirus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9391.mp3	sir dodynas le sauvage sir ozanna sir ladynas sir persant of inde sir ironside and sir pelleas and these ten knights made them ready
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9392.mp3	so upon the morn they took their horses with the queen and rode a maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them in great joy and delight now there was a knight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9393.mp3	son to king brademagus who loved queen guenever passing well and so had he done long and many years now this knight sir maleagans learned the queen's purpose and that she had no men of arms with her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9394.mp3	but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for maying so he prepared him twenty men of arms and a hundred archers to take captive the queen and her knights
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9395.mp3	in the merry month of may in a morn at break of day with a troop of damsels playing the queen forsooth went forth a maying old song so when the queen had mayed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9396.mp3	traitor knight said queen guenever what wilt thou do wilt thou shame thyself bethink thee how thou art a king's son and a knight of the table round and how thou art about to dishonor all knighthood and thyself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9397.mp3	be it as it may said sir maleagans know you well madam i have loved you many a year and never till now could i get you to such advantage as i do now and therefore i will take you as i find you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9398.mp3	then the ten knights of the round table drew their swords and the other party run at them with their spears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9399.mp3	then they lashed together with swords till several were smitten to the earth so when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully oppressed and needs must be slain at the last then for pity and sorrow she cried sir maleagans
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9400.mp3	slay not my noble knights and i will go with you upon this covenant that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9401.mp3	madame said maleagans for your sake they shall be led with you into my own castle if that ye will be ruled and ride with me then sir maleagans charged them all that none should depart from the queen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9402.mp3	for he dreaded lest sir launcelot should have knowledge of what had been done then the queen privily called unto her a page of her chamber that was swiftly horsed to whom she said go thou when thou seest thy time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9403.mp3	and bear this ring unto sir launcelot and pray him as he loveth me that he will see me and rescue me and spare not thy horse said the queen neither for water nor for land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9404.mp3	and lightly he took his horse with the spurs and departed as fast as he might and when sir maleagans saw him so flee he understood that it was by the queen's commandment for to warn sir launcelot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9405.mp3	then they that were best horsed chased him and shot at him but the child went from them all then sir maleagans said to the queen madam ye are about to betray me but i shall arrange for sir launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9406.mp3	then he rode with her and them all to his castle in all the haste that they might and by the way sir maleagans laid in ambush the best archers that he had to wait for sir launcelot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9407.mp3	and the child came to westminster and found sir launcelot and told his message and delivered him the queen's ring alas said sir launcelot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9408.mp3	unless i may rescue that noble lady then eagerly he asked his armor and put it on him and mounted his horse and rode as fast as he might
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9409.mp3	and men say he took the water at westminster bridge and made his horse swim over thames unto lambeth then within a while he came to a wood where was a narrow way and there the archers were laid in ambush
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9410.mp3	and they shot at him and smote his horse so that he fell then sir launcelot left his horse and went on foot but there lay so many ditches and hedges betwixt the archers and him that he might not meddle with them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9411.mp3	alas for shame said sir launcelot that ever one knight should betray another but it is an old saw a good man is never in danger but when he is in danger of a coward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9412.mp3	then sir launcelot went awhile and he was exceedingly cumbered by his armor his shield and his spear and all that belonged to him then by chance there came by him a cart that came thither to fetch wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9413.mp3	carts were little used except for carrying offal and for conveying criminals to execution but sir launcelot took no thought of anything but the necessity of haste for the purpose of rescuing the queen so he demanded of the carter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9414.mp3	that he should take him in and convey him as speedily as possible for a liberal reward the carter consented and sir launcelot placed himself in the cart and only lamented that with much jolting he made but little progress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9415.mp3	he drew near to see who it might be then sir launcelot told him how the queen had been carried off and how in hastening to her rescue his horse had been disabled and he had been compelled to avail himself of the cart rather than give up his enterprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9416.mp3	then sir gawain said surely it is unworthy of a knight to travel in such sort but sir launcelot heeded him not at nightfall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9417.mp3	but to admit his companion whom she supposed to be a criminal or at least a prisoner it pleased her not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9418.mp3	at supper sir launcelot came near being consigned to the kitchen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9419.mp3	neither would the damsels prepare a bed for him he seized the first he found unoccupied and was left undisturbed next morning he saw from the turrets of the castle a train accompanying a lady whom he imagined to be the queen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9420.mp3	the lady of the castle supplied sir launcelot with a horse and they traversed the plain at full speed they learned from some travellers whom they met that there were two roads which led to the castle of sir maleagans here therefore the friends separated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9421.mp3	sir launcelot found his way beset with obstacles which he encountered successfully but not without much loss of time as evening approached he was met by a young and sportive damsel who gayly proposed to him a supper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9422.mp3	at her castle the knight who was hungry and weary accepted the offer though with no very good grace he followed the lady to her castle and ate voraciously of her supper but was quite impenetrable to all her amorous advances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9423.mp3	suddenly the scene changed and he was assailed by six furious ruffians whom he dealt with so vigorously that most of them were speedily disabled when again there was a change and he found himself alone with his fair hostess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9424.mp3	which she told him would by its changes of color disclose to him all enchantments and enable him to subdue them sir launcelot pursued his journey without being much incommoded except by the taunts of travellers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9425.mp3	who all seemed to have learned by some means his disgraceful drive in the cart one more insolent than the rest had the audacity to interrupt him during dinner and even to risk a battle in support of his pleasantry launcelot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9426.mp3	after an easy victory only doomed him to be carted in his turn at night he was received at another castle with great apparent hospitality but found himself in the morning in a dungeon and loaded with chains
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9427.mp3	consulting his ring and finding that this was an enchantment he burst his chains seized his armor in spite of the visionary monsters who attempted to defend it broke open the gates of the tower and continued his journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9428.mp3	at length his progress was checked by a wide and rapid torrent which could only be passed on a narrow bridge on which a false step would prove his destruction launcelot leading his horse by the bridle and making him swim by his side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9429.mp3	passed over the bridge and was attacked as soon as he reached the bank by a lion and a leopard both of which he slew and then exhausted and bleeding seated himself on the grass and endeavored to bind up his wounds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9430.mp3	offered him his assistance and informed him that the queen was safe in his castle but could only be rescued by encountering maleagans launcelot demanded the battle for the next day and accordingly it took place at the foot of the tower
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9431.mp3	and under the eyes of the fair captive launcelot was enfeebled by his wounds and fought not with his usual spirit and the contest for a time was doubtful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9432.mp3	ah launcelot my knight truly have i been told that thou art no longer worthy of me these words instantly revived the drooping knight he resumed at once his usual superiority and soon laid at his feet his haughty adversary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9433.mp3	moved by the entreaties of brademagus ordered him to withhold the blow and he obeyed the castle and its prisoners were now at his disposal launcelot hastened to the apartment of the queen threw himself at her feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9434.mp3	and was about to kiss her hand when she exclaimed ah launcelot why do i see thee again yet feel thee to be no longer worthy of me after having been disgracefully drawn about the country in a she had not time to finish the phrase
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9435.mp3	for her lover suddenly started from her and bitterly lamenting that he had incurred the displeasure of his sovereign lady rushed out of the castle threw his sword and his shield to the right and left ran furiously into the woods and disappeared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9436.mp3	it seems that the story of the abominable cart which haunted launcelot at every step had reached the ears of sir kay who had told it to the queen as a proof that her knight must have been dishonored
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9437.mp3	three days elapsed during which launcelot wandered without knowing where he went till at last he began to reflect that his mistress had doubtless been deceived by misrepresentation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9438.mp3	and that it was his duty to set her right he therefore returned compelled maleagans to release his prisoners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9439.mp3	had the satisfaction of meeting him the next day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9440.mp3	where he was brought up in total ignorance of arms and chivalry he was allowed no weapon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9441.mp3	which was the only thing of all her lordes faire gere that his mother carried to the wood with her in the use of this he became so skilful that he could kill with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9442.mp3	not only the animals of the chase for the table but even birds on the wing at length however perceval was roused to a desire of military renown by seeing in the forest five knights who were in complete armor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9443.mp3	he said to his mother mother what are those yonder they are angels my son said she by my faith i will go and become an angel with them and perceval went to the road and met them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9444.mp3	tell me good lad said one of them sawest thou a knight pass this way either today or yesterday
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9445.mp3	such an one as i am said the knight if thou wilt tell me what i ask thee i will tell thee what thou askest me gladly will i do so said sir owain for that was the knight's name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9446.mp3	and perceval in return gave him such information as he had then perceval returned to his mother and said to her mother those were not angels but honorable knights then his mother swooned away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9447.mp3	and perceval went to the place where they kept the horses that carried firewood and provisions for the castle and he took a bony piebald horse which seemed to him the strongest of them and he pressed a pack into the form of a saddle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9448.mp3	and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses when he came again to his mother the countess had recovered from her swoon my son said she desirest thou to ride forth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9449.mp3	yes with thy leave said he go forward then she said to the court of arthur where there are the best and the noblest and the most bountiful of men and tell him thou art perceval the son of pelenore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9450.mp3	and ask of him to bestow knighthood on thee and whenever thou seest a church repeat there thy pater noster
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9451.mp3	for thus shalt thou acquire fame yet freely give it to another for thus thou shalt obtain praise if thou see a fair woman pay court to her for thus thou wilt obtain love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9452.mp3	perceiving in one corner of the tent some food two flasks full of wine and some boar's flesh roasted he said my mother told me whenever i saw meat and drink to take it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9453.mp3	and he ate greedily for he was very hungry the maiden said sir thou hadst best go quickly from here for fear that my friends should come and evil should befall you but perceval said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9454.mp3	and he gave the maiden his own ring in exchange for hers then he mounted his horse and rode away perceval journeyed on till he arrived at arthur's court and it so happened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9455.mp3	for when her page was serving the queen with a golden goblet this knight struck the arm of the page and dashed the wine in the queen's face and over her stomacher then he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9456.mp3	let him follow me to the meadow so the knight took his horse and rode to the meadow carrying away the golden goblet and all the household hung down their heads and no one offered to follow the knight to take vengeance upon him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9457.mp3	for it seemed to them that no one would have ventured on so daring an outrage unless he possessed such powers through magic or charms that none could be able to punish him just then behold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9458.mp3	perceval entered the hall upon the bony piebald horse with his uncouth trappings in the centre of the hall stood kay the seneschal tell me tall man said perceval is that arthur yonder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9459.mp3	what wouldst thou with arthur asked kay my mother told me to go to arthur and receive knighthood from him by my faith said he thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and with arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9460.mp3	then all the household began to jeer and laugh at him but there was a certain damsel who had been a whole year at arthur's court
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9461.mp3	and the king's fool footnote a fool was a common appendage of the courts of those days when this romance was written a fool was the ornament held in next estimation to a dwarf he wore a white dress with a yellow bonnet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9462.mp3	and carried a bell or bawble in his hand though called a fool his words were often weighed and remembered as if there were a sort of oracular meaning in them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9463.mp3	till she had seen him who would be the flower of chivalry now this damsel came up to perceval and told him smiling that if he lived he would be one of the bravest and best of knights truly said kay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9464.mp3	thou art ill taught to remain a year at arthur's court with choice of society and smile on no one and now before the face of arthur and all his knights to call such a man as this the flower of knighthood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9465.mp3	that she fell senseless to the ground then said kay to perceval go after the knight who went hence to the meadow overthrow him and recover the golden goblet and possess thyself of his horse and arms and thou shalt have knighthood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9466.mp3	i will do so tall man said perceval so he turned his horse's head toward the meadow and when he came there the knight was riding up and down proud of his strength and valor and noble mien tell me said the knight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9467.mp3	didst thou see any one coming after me from the court
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9468.mp3	and to take from thee the goblet and thy horse and armor for myself silence said the knight go back to the court and tell arthur either to come himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9469.mp3	and unless he do so quickly i will not wait for him by my faith said perceval choose thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly for i will have the horse and the arms and the goblet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9470.mp3	upon this the knight ran at him furiously and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9471.mp3	my mother's servants were not used to play with me in this wise so thus will i play with thee and he threw at him one of his sharp pointed sticks and it struck him in the eye and came out at the back of his head so that he fell down lifeless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9472.mp3	verily said sir owain the son of urien to kay the seneschal thou wast ill advised to send that madman after the knight for he must either be overthrown or flee and either way it will be a disgrace to arthur and his warriors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9473.mp3	therefore will i go to see what has befallen him so sir owain went to the meadow and he found perceval trying in vain to get the dead knight's armor off in order to clothe himself with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9474.mp3	sir owain unfastened the armor and helped perceval to put it on and taught him how to put his foot in the stirrup and use the spur
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9475.mp3	and urged on his horse with a stick then owain would have had him return to the court to receive the praise that was his due but perceval said i will not come to the court till i have encountered the tall man that is there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9476.mp3	to revenge the injury he did to the maiden but take thou the goblet to queen guenever and tell king arthur that wherever i am i will be his vassal and will do him what profit and service i can and sir owain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9477.mp3	went back to the court and related all these things to arthur and guenever and to all the household
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9478.mp3	and he came to a lake on the side of which was a fair castle and on the border of the lake he saw a hoary headed man sitting upon a velvet cushion and his attendants were fishing in the lake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9479.mp3	when the hoary headed man beheld perceval approaching he arose and went into the castle perceval rode to the castle and the door was open and he entered the hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9480.mp3	and the hoary headed man received perceval courteously and asked him to sit by him on the cushion when it was time the tables were set and they went to meat and when they had finished their meat the hoary headed man asked perceval
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9481.mp3	if he knew how to fight with the sword i know not said perceval but were i to be taught doubtless i should and the hoary headed man said to him i am thy uncle thy mother's brother i am called king pecheur
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9482.mp3	footnote the word means both fisher and sinner thou shalt remain with me a space in order to learn the manners and customs of different countries and courtesy and noble bearing and this do thou remember
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9483.mp3	if thou seest aught to cause thy wonder ask not the meaning of it if no one has the courtesy to inform thee the reproach will not fall upon thee but upon me that am thy teacher
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9484.mp3	while perceval and his uncle discoursed together perceval beheld two youths enter the hall bearing a golden cup and a spear of mighty size with blood dropping from its point to the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9485.mp3	and when all the company saw this they began to weep and lament but for all that the man did not break off his discourse with perceval and as he did not tell him the meaning of what he saw he forebore to ask him concerning it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9486.mp3	now the cup that perceval saw was the sangreal and the spear the sacred spear and afterwards king pecheur removed with those sacred relics into a far country one evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9487.mp3	perceval entered a valley and came to a hermit's cell and the hermit welcomed him gladly and there he spent the night and in the morning he arose and when he went forth behold a shower of snow had fallen in the night and a hawk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9488.mp3	had killed a wild fowl in front of the cell and the noise of the horse had scared the hawk away and a raven alighted on the bird and perceval stood and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the snow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9489.mp3	to the hair of the lady that best he loved which was blacker than jet and to her skin which was whiter than the snow and to the two red spots upon her cheeks which were redder than the blood upon the snow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9490.mp3	now arthur and his household were in search of perceval and by chance they came that way know ye said arthur who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook up yonder lord said one of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9491.mp3	i will go and learn who he is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9492.mp3	and who he was but perceval was so intent upon his thought that he gave him no answer then the youth thrust at perceval with his lance and perceval turned upon him and struck him to the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9493.mp3	and when the youth returned to the king and told how rudely he had been treated sir kay said i will go myself and when he greeted perceval and got no answer he spoke to him rudely and angrily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9494.mp3	and perceval thrust at him with his lance and cast him down so that he broke his arm and his shoulder blade and while he lay thus stunned his horse returned back at a wild and prancing pace then said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9495.mp3	surnamed the golden tongued because he was the most courteous knight in arthur's court it is not fitting that any should disturb an honorable knight from his thought unadvisedly for either he is pondering some damage that he has sustained
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9496.mp3	or he is thinking of the lady whom best he loves if it seem well to thee lord i will go and see if this knight has changed from his thought and if he has i will ask him courteously to come and visit thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9497.mp3	and perceval was resting on the shaft of his spear pondering the same thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9498.mp3	if i thought it would be as agreeable to thee as it would be to me i would converse with thee i have also a message from arthur unto thee to pray thee to come and visit him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9499.mp3	and two men have been before on this errand that is true said perceval and uncourteously they came they attacked me and i was annoyed thereat then he told him the thought that occupied his mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9500.mp3	and gawain said this was not an ungentle thought and i should marvel if it were pleasant for thee to be drawn from it then said perceval tell me is sir kay in arthur's court
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9501.mp3	and truly he is the knight who fought with thee last verily said perceval i am not sorry to have thus avenged the insult to the smiling maiden then perceval told him his name and said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9502.mp3	who art thou and he replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9503.mp3	i am right glad to meet thee said perceval for i have everywhere heard of thy prowess and uprightness and i solicit thy fellowship thou shalt have it by my faith and grant me thine said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9504.mp3	gladly will i do so answered perceval so they went together to arthur and saluted him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9505.mp3	him whom thou hast sought so long welcome unto thee chieftain said arthur and hereupon there came the queen and her handmaidens and perceval saluted them and they were rejoiced to see him and bade him welcome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9506.mp3	why mister cropper changed his mind well miss maxwell how did you get along today asked mister baxter affably when the new teacher came to the table she was a slight dark girl rather plain looking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9507.mp3	but with a smart energetic way mister baxter approved of her he liked her style as he would have said the summer term had just opened in the maitland district esther maxwell was a stranger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9508.mp3	but she was a capable girl and had no doubt of her own ability to get and keep the school in good working order she smiled brightly at mister baxter very well for a beginning the children seem bright and teachable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9509.mp3	and not hard to control mister baxter nodded there are no bad children in the school except the cropper boys and they can be good enough if they like reckon they weren't there today no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9510.mp3	well miss maxwell i think it only fair to tell you that you may have trouble with those boys when they do come forewarned is forearmed you know mister cropper was opposed to our hiring you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9511.mp3	not of course that he had any personal objection to you but he is set against female teachers and when a cropper is set there is nothing on earth can change him he says female teachers can't keep order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9512.mp3	they know he'll back them up in secret no matter what they do just to prove his opinions cropper is sly and slippery and it is hard to corner him are the boys big queried esther anxiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9513.mp3	yes thirteen and fourteen and big for their age you can't whip em that is the trouble a man might but they'd twist you around their fingers you'll have your hands full i'm afraid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9514.mp3	but maybe they'll behave all right after all mister baxter privately had no hope that they would but esther hoped for the best she could not believe that mister cropper would carry his prejudices into a personal application
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9515.mp3	this conviction was strengthened when he overtook her walking from school the next day and drove her home he was a big handsome man with a very suave polite manner he asked interestedly about her school and her work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9516.mp3	hoped she was getting on well and said he had two young rascals of his own to send soon esther felt relieved she thought that mister baxter had exaggerated matters a little that plum tree of missus charley's is loaded with fruit again this year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9517.mp3	remarked mister baxter at the tea table that evening i came past it today on my way cross lots home from the woods there will be bushels of plums on it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9518.mp3	i don't suppose poor missus charley will get one of them any more than she ever has said missus baxter indignantly it's a burning shame that's what it is i just wish she could catch the croppers once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9519.mp3	you haven't any proof that it is really them mary objected her husband and you shouldn't make reckless accusations before folks i know very well it is them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9520.mp3	and missus charley knows it too although she can't prove it more's the pity i don't say isaac cropper steals those plums with his own hands but he knows who does and the plums go into mehitable cropper's preserving kettle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9521.mp3	there's nothing surer you see miss maxwell it's this way explained mister baxter turning to esther missus charley cropper's husband was isaac's brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9522.mp3	they never got on well together and when charley died there was a tremendous fuss about the property isaac acted mean and scandalous clear through and public opinion has been down on him ever since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9523.mp3	but missus charley is a pretty smart woman and he didn't get the better of her in everything there was a strip of disputed land between the two farms and she secured it there's a big plum tree growing on it close to the line fence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9524.mp3	it's the finest one in maitland but missus charley never gets a plum from it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9525.mp3	asked esther they disappear said mister baxter with a significant nod when the plums are anything like ripe missus charley discovers some day that there isn't one left on the tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9526.mp3	she has never been able to get a scrap of proof as to who took them or she'd make it hot for them but nobody in maitland has any doubt in his own mind that isaac cropper knows where those plums go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9527.mp3	i don't think mister cropper would steal protested esther well he doesn't consider it stealing you know he claims the land and says the plums are his
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9528.mp3	i don't doubt that he is quite clear in his own mind that they are and he does hate missus charley i'd give considerable to see the old sinner fairly caught but he is too deep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9529.mp3	i think mister baxter is too hard on mister cropper said esther to herself later on he has probably some private prejudice against him but a month later she had changed her opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9530.mp3	during that time the cropper boys had come to school at first esther had been inclined to like them they were handsome lads with the same smooth way that characterized their father and seemed bright and intelligent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9531.mp3	for a few days all went well and esther felt decidedly relieved but before long a subtle spirit of insubordination began to make itself felt in the school esther found herself powerless to cope with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9532.mp3	the croppers never openly defied her but they did precisely as they pleased the other pupils thought themselves at liberty to follow this example and in a month's time poor esther had completely lost control of her little kingdom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9533.mp3	some complaints were heard among the ratepayers and even mister baxter looked dubious she knew that unless she could regain her authority she would be requested to hand in her resignation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9534.mp3	but she was baffled by the elusive system of defiance which the cropper boys had organized one day she resolved to go to mister cropper himself and appeal to his sense of justice if he had any
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9535.mp3	it had been an especially hard day in school when she had been absent at the noon hour all the desks in the schoolroom had been piled in a pyramid on the floor books and slates interchanged and various other pranks played
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9536.mp3	when questioned every pupil denied having done or helped to do it alfred and bob cropper looked her squarely in the eyes and declared their innocence in their usual gentlemanly fashion yet esther felt sure that they were the guilty ones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9537.mp3	she also knew what exaggerated accounts of the affair would be taken home to maitland tea tables and she felt like sitting down to cry but she did not instead she set her mouth firmly helped the children restore the room to order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9538.mp3	and after school went up to isaac cropper's house that gentleman himself came in from the harvest field looking as courtly as usual even in his rough working clothes he shook hands heartily told her he was glad to see her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9539.mp3	and began talking about the weather esther was not to be turned from her object thus although she felt her courage ebbing away from her as it always did in the presence of the cropper imperviousness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9540.mp3	i have come up to see you about alfred and robert mister cropper she said they are not behaving well in school indeed mister cropper's voice expressed bland surprise that is strange
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9541.mp3	as a rule i do not think alfred and robert have been troublesome to their teachers what have they been doing now they refuse to obey my orders said esther faintly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9542.mp3	my boys are high spirited fellows and need a strong firm hand to restrain them i have always said i considered it advisable to employ a male teacher in maitland school we should have better order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9543.mp3	not that i disapprove of you personally far from it i should be glad to see you succeed but i have heard many complaints regarding the order in school at present i had no trouble until your boys came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9544.mp3	retorted esther losing her temper a little and i believe that if you were willing to co operate with me that i could govern them well you see said mister cropper easily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9545.mp3	when i send my boys to school i naturally expect that the teacher will be capable of doing the work she has been hired to do then you refuse to help me said esther in a trembling voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9546.mp3	why my dear young lady what can i do boys soon know when they can disobey a teacher with impunity no doubt you will be able to secure a school easier to control and will do good work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9547.mp3	but here as i have already said we need a firm hand at the helm but you are not going yet miss maxwell you need some refreshment after your long walk missus cropper will bring you in something no thank you said poor esther
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9548.mp3	she felt that she must get away at once or she would burst into heartsick tears under those steely bland blue eyes when she got home she shut herself up in her room and cried there was nothing for her to do but resign she thought dismally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9549.mp3	on the following saturday esther went for an afternoon walk carrying her kodak with her it was a brilliantly fine autumn day and woods and fields were basking in a mellow haze esther went across lots to missus charley cropper's house intending to make a call
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9550.mp3	but the house was locked up and evidently deserted so she rambled past it to the back fields passing through a grove of maples she came out among leafy young saplings on the other side just beyond her with its laden boughs hanging over the line fence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9551.mp3	was the famous plum tree esther looked at it for a moment then an odd smile gleamed over her face and she lifted her kodak monday evening esther called on mister cropper again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9552.mp3	after the preliminary remarks in which he indulged she said with seeming irrelevance that saturday had been a fine day there was an excellent light for snapshots she went on coolly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9553.mp3	i have brought you up a proof i thought you would be interested in it she rose and placed the proof on the table before mister cropper the plum tree came out clearly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9554.mp3	bob and alf cropper were up among the boughs picking the plums on the ground beneath them stood their father with a basket of fruit in his hand mister cropper looked at the proof and from it to esther
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9555.mp3	his eyes had lost their unconcerned glitter but his voice was defiant the plums are mine by right he said perhaps said esther calmly but there are some who do not think so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9556.mp3	missus charley for instance she would like to see this proof i think don't show it to her cried mister cropper hastily i tell you miss maxwell the plums are mine but i am tired of fighting over them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9557.mp3	and i had decided before this that i'd let her have them after this it's only a trifle anyhow and about that little matter we were discussing the other night miss maxwell i have been thinking it over and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9558.mp3	i admit i was somewhat unreasonable i'll talk to alfred and robert and see what i can do very well said esther quietly the matter of the plums isn't my business
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9559.mp3	and i don't wish to be involved in your family feuds especially as you say that you mean to allow missus charley to enjoy her own in future as for the school we will hope that matters will improve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9560.mp3	you'll leave the proof with me won't you said mister cropper eagerly oh certainly said esther smiling i have the negative still you know from that time out the cropper boys were models of good behaviour and the other turbulent spirits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9561.mp3	having lost their leaders were soon quelled complaint died away and at the end of the term esther was re engaged you seem to have won old cropper over to your side entirely mister baxter told her that night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9562.mp3	i never knew isaac cropper to change his opinions so handsomely esther smiled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9563.mp3	when the boat was nearing the island of marken the little yellow cheese had been presented with all due formality to one of the sailors who had been specially kind in the matter of securing good seats for mister king's party polly and phronsie having held a whispered conference in a retired nook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9564.mp3	to come out of it bright and smiling and now it has made two people happy phronsie polly had said when the presentation was well over and she ended up with a kiss it made me happy in the first place because you thought of me and then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9565.mp3	perhaps so said polly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9566.mp3	well maybe he has some we'll think so anyway polly answered oh see jasper is calling us to be sure there he was on the other side of the boat nearest marken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9567.mp3	and holding out their arms singing something all the while in a shrill high key
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9568.mp3	cried jasper come polly and phronsie let us toss them some whiz spin went the coins to fall into the thick stubby grass on the bank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9569.mp3	the children stopping their song in mid air scrambled and sprawled all over each other in their efforts to secure the coveted money so jasper and polly threw the bits next time in the other direction then there was a shout and a rush
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9570.mp3	and the same thing was repeated till only a tangle of arms and legs could be seen but some one of them always got the money dear me they've eyes just like birds exclaimed parson henderson to think of finding anything in that thick grass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9571.mp3	let them alone for that laughed old mister king their wits are sharpened by practice look out phronsie exclaimed jasper your stuivers went into the water here i'll hold you up then you can throw it farther
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9572.mp3	there you go swinging her to his shoulder now then he guided her hand and away spun the coin it did it did crowed phronsie from her high perch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9573.mp3	so it did pet well now here is another there's a little girl back there and she hasn't any mourned phronsie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9574.mp3	to be sure said jasper well we must give her some and that's a fact the small girl kept on at a dog trot along the bank her eyes fixed on the wonderful people who tossed out such magic wealth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9575.mp3	and holding out her arms and singing her shrill song but when the money was thrown she was always a bit too late and the other children scrambling and scuffling had pounced upon it and had made off with it here you boys keep away you've had enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9576.mp3	we're going to give this to the little girl jasper shouted to them as they threw coin after coin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9577.mp3	said old mister king laughing heartily at the performance and they wouldn't mind you in the least if they did i suppose not said jasper in chagrin oh the mean little beggars hold up your apron screamed polly to the little girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9578.mp3	that's a good idea said jasper why didn't we think of it before she won't understand any better than the boys said old mister king you forget children that these youngsters don't know our language
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9579.mp3	what a bother exclaimed jasper it is to have so many different languages anyway and she hasn't any apron polly corrected her mother that is her brown gown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9580.mp3	polly was already going through the motions of holding up an imaginary apron and at last the little girl understood by gestures what she could not possibly get into her head by words so she picked up the skirt of her gown in her sturdy little fists
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9581.mp3	and one two three clinking coins fell safely into it but the boys racing along in advance soon discovered this successful trick and completely swarmed around her howling dreadfully so she hastened off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9582.mp3	happy in her prize which she huddled up in her gown as she ran isn't this just richness exclaimed polly gazing all about her in an ecstasy oh jasper what pictures we'll take and do see that woman's cap and those pot hooks of hair over her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9583.mp3	take care polly you almost stepped off backward down the bank warned adela pulling her back as they got off the steamboat and stopped a bit to look around
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9584.mp3	said polly well it's enough to make any one step backward to see such funny clothes and they are hay making adela gray as sure as you live didn't you suppose they would be answered adela composedly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9585.mp3	why that's one of the things i specially wanted to see yes so did i said polly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9586.mp3	then she stopped and looked at adela you may first she said no i'm not going to declared adela yes yes said polly i'd rather you did first i truly had adela
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9587.mp3	she ran after her for adela had retreated down the bank and made as if she were going to follow the party now adela be good and listen to reason but adela ran off now that's too bad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9588.mp3	mourned polly for i'm afraid she'll keep away from me all the while we're on this island and then i can't get a chance to give her my kodak at all she had it at the model farm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9589.mp3	said polly such a little bit of a while doesn't count well let us take pictures as fast as we can suggested jasper and then when we do come up with adela why you'll have yours done so polly roused out of her dejection and set to work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9590.mp3	and presently the hay makers and the marken boys and girls the funny little houses that looked as if they dropped down pellmell from the clouds and settled where they had dropped the high ridges along which the men and boys walking in their full baggy trousers looked as if they were blown up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9591.mp3	and formed a dutch perspective perfectly awful all these queer delightful things were presently imprisoned in the two kodaks jasper looked up there that's my last picture he declared at any rate for now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9592.mp3	polly ran off a few steps and sat down on a log to focus the marken girls happened to look up and immediately whirled around and presented their backs to her oh dear how hateful she exclaimed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9593.mp3	that would have been a splendid picture never mind said jasper you can catch them unawares and have another try at them not so good as that said polly sorrowfully well it can't be helped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9594.mp3	so she was just going to get up from her log when the girls thinking from her attitude that she had given up the idea of taking a picture of them turned back to their work as quick as a flash polly focussed again and was just touching the button
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9595.mp3	when a hand came in front of her kodak and she saw the grinning face of a marken girl under its pot hook of hair and with the long dangling curl on one side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9596.mp3	and don't you ever do that again and the hand was withdrawn and the girl clattered off as fast as she could run in her wooden shoes i got them said polly running back in triumph to jasper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9597.mp3	yes and i took a picture of the saucy girl while she was trying to stop yours said jasper so she didn't do much harm after all oh here is a splendid group see them standing by that old tumble down house polly he added excitedly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9598.mp3	well i had then but i've begun again said jasper recklessly he walked up to the group and held out his hand then pointed to his kodak they smiled and nodded showing all their teeth and the mother took the littlest baby
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9599.mp3	for there seemed to be a very generous number of the smaller members of the family and sat down with it in her lap on the rickety step then they all drew up stiff as sticks and didn't even wink that's capital said jasper in huge satisfaction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9600.mp3	pouring the coins into the mother's lap where they rolled underneath the fat baby
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9601.mp3	said phronsie as polly and jasper ran up to a doorway through which they could see their party phronsie stood just inside and appeared to be watching for them there's a woman here who's been showing us things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9602.mp3	there was missus fisher up by the tiny window bending over an old woman who had spread out in her lap some white embroidered garments while a young woman hovered near smiling and blushing and very happy at all this notice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9603.mp3	and the rest of the party crowded up as close as they could they are her daughter's wedding clothes said missus fisher i do believe for the old woman was working fearfully hard to make them understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9604.mp3	and pointing first to the white garments and then to the young woman wedding clothes asked missus fisher speaking very slowly the old woman seemed to understand the one word wedding for she nodded furiously and smiled well pleased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9605.mp3	and then devoted her whole time and energy to the display of the garments and she even laughed aloud when old mister king put some coins in her hard hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9606.mp3	she confided to jasper when once out of doors how else could they be pulled so tight and they look as hard as a drum i didn't investigate he said laughing i'll leave that to you polly well it's funny anyway she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9607.mp3	and those embroidered jackets over their waists and those caps and horrible pot hooks and long curls it's well that we've got so many pictures for the people at home would never believe our stories without them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9608.mp3	continued polly squinting up at a crooked row all colours green stripes and black stripes and o dear me jasper king just look at phronsie jasper followed the direction of polly's finger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9609.mp3	there sat phronsie on a grassy bank a little above them with one of the fattest marken babies in her lap a variegated group of natives was near by watching her intently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9610.mp3	sighed phronsie giving motherly pats to the stout little legs dangling down from her lap come children grandpapa emerged from the little old house we must hurry on else we sha'n't get through this island come phronsie goodness me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9611.mp3	begged phronsie staggering to her feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9612.mp3	goodness me no child exclaimed grandpapa in horror put her down phronsie she's ever so much too heavy for you dear he put forth a protesting hand but the tears ran down phronsie's cheeks and fell on the baby's stiff white cap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9613.mp3	at that old mister king was quite gone in despair phronsie polly bent over and whispered close to the wet little cheek don't you see grandpapa is feeling badly i'm afraid he will be sick phronsie if he is unhappy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9614.mp3	the roman and the persian empires drained of men and money and ravaged from end to end by each other's marauding armies sank down in exhaustion to heal them of their deadly wounds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9615.mp3	never before had either power dealt its neighbour such fearful blows as in this last struggle in previous wars the contest had been waged around border fortresses and the prize had been the conquest of some small slice of marchland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9616.mp3	had struck deadly blows at the heart of each other's empire and harried the inmost provinces up to the gates of each other's capitals the persian had turned the wild hordes of the avars loose on thrace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9617.mp3	they were bleeding at every pore utterly wearied and exhausted and desirous of nothing but a long interval of peace to recover their lost strength precisely at this moment a new and terrible enemy fell upon the two war worn combatants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9618.mp3	and delivered an attack so vehement that it was destined to destroy the ancient kingdom of persia and to shear away half the provinces of the roman empire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9619.mp3	the politics of arabia had up to this time been of little moment either to roman or persian each of them had allies among the arab tribes and had sometimes sent an expedition or an embassy southward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9620.mp3	into the land beyond the syrian desert but neither of them dreamed that the scattered and disunited tribes of arabia would ever combine or become a serious danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9621.mp3	events of world wide importance had been taking place in the arabian peninsula for the first and last time in history there had arisen among the arabs one of those world compelling minds that are destined to turn aside the current of events

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9623.mp3	by an extraordinary mixture of genuine enthusiasm and vulgar cunning of self deception and deliberate imposture of benevolence and cruelty of austerity and licence he had worked himself and his creed to the front
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9624.mp3	the turbulent polytheists of arabia had by him been converted into a compact band of fanatics burning to carry all over the world by the force of their swords their new war cry that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9625.mp3	god was god and mahomet his prophet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9626.mp3	bidding them embrace islam the persian replied with the threat that he would put the prophet in chains when he had leisure the roman made no direct reply but sent mahomet some small presents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9627.mp3	neglecting the theological bent of his message and only thinking of enlisting a possible political ally both answers were regarded as equally unsatisfactory by the prophet and he doomed the two empires to a similar destruction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9628.mp3	is not a thing to be despised
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9629.mp3	nor scoff with gibbon at the feebleness of the troops who were routed by them if the soldiers of queen victoria armed with modern rifles and artillery found the fanatical arab a formidable foe let us not blame the soldiers of heraclius who faced the same enemy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9630.mp3	in the early engagements between the east romans and the saracens the superior discipline and more regular arms of the one

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9632.mp3	the roman fought well enough but he did not like his adversary yearn to become a martyr and the odds were on the man who held his life the cheapest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9633.mp3	and to do so had not only drained the treasury but imposed some new and unwise taxes on the harassed provincials and disbanded many of his veterans for the sake of economy

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9650.mp3	he was in short of the stuff of which tyrants are made justinian was but seventeen when he came to the throne but he soon showed that he intended to rule the empire after his own good pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9651.mp3	long before he had begun to learn the lessons of state craft ere he had reached his twenty first year justinian had plunged into war with the bulgarians he attacked them suddenly inflicted several defeats on their king

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9654.mp3	and the roman army was routed with great slaughter the two subsequent campaigns were equally unsuccessful

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9784.mp3	what a horrible palace he thought restless he wandered through the maze asking himself what it all meant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9785.mp3	and must be held unbroken to guide him out of it now and then he shouted ho any one there no one answered the rooms never came to an end all was deserted silent splendid sinister

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9793.mp3	part two some christian subjects
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9794.mp3	outward forms and symbols must be used to convey intellectual conceptions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9795.mp3	and of others of which we are about to speak so that the essence of the problems may be understood is this that human knowledge is of two kinds one is the knowledge of things perceptible to the senses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9796.mp3	that is to say things which the eye or ear or smell or taste or touch can perceive which are called objective or sensible so the sun because it can be seen is said to be objective
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9797.mp3	it is a reality of the intellect it has no outward form and no place and is not perceptible to the senses for example the power of intellect is not sensible none of the inner qualities of man is a sensible thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9798.mp3	on the contrary they are intellectual realities so love is a mental reality and not sensible for this reality the ear does not hear the eye does not see the smell does not perceive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9799.mp3	the taste does not discern the touch does not feel even ethereal matter the forces of which are said in physics to be heat light electricity and magnetism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9800.mp3	is an intellectual reality and is not sensible in the same way nature also in its essence is an intellectual reality and is not sensible the human spirit is an intellectual not sensible reality
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9801.mp3	in explaining these intellectual realities one is obliged to express them by sensible figures because in exterior existence there is nothing that is not material therefore to explain the reality of the spirit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9802.mp3	its condition its station one is obliged to give explanations under the forms of sensible things because in the external world all that exists is sensible for example grief and happiness are intellectual things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9803.mp3	this is an intellectual or spiritual state to explain which you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures another example you say such an individual made great progress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9804.mp3	though he is remaining in the same place or again such a one's position was exalted although like everyone else he walks upon the earth this exaltation and this progress are spiritual states and intellectual realities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9805.mp3	but to explain them you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures because in the exterior world there is nothing that is not sensible so the symbol of knowledge is light and of ignorance darkness but reflect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9806.mp3	is knowledge sensible light or ignorance sensible darkness no they are merely symbols these are only intellectual states
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9807.mp3	but when you desire to express them outwardly you call knowledge light and ignorance darkness you say my heart was gloomy and it became enlightened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9808.mp3	now that light of knowledge and that darkness of ignorance are intellectual realities not sensible ones but when we seek for explanations in the external world we are obliged to give them a sensible form
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9809.mp3	then it is evident that the dove which descended upon christ was not a material dove but it was a spiritual state which that it might be comprehensible was expressed by a sensible figure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9810.mp3	thus in the old testament it is said that god appeared as a pillar of fire this does not signify the material form it is an intellectual reality which is expressed by a sensible image
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9811.mp3	a simile a metaphor and is not to be accepted literally it is not a state that can be comprehended by man sleeping and waking is passing from one state to another sleeping is the condition of repose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9812.mp3	and wakefulness is the condition of movement sleeping is the state of silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9813.mp3	sleeping is the state of mystery wakefulness is the state of manifestation for example it is a persian and arabic expression to say that the earth was asleep and the spring came and it awoke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9814.mp3	or the earth was dead and the spring came and it revived these expressions are metaphors allegories mystic explanations in the world of signification briefly the holy manifestations have ever been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9815.mp3	and ever will be luminous realities no change or variation takes place in their essence before declaring their manifestation they are silent and quiet like a sleeper and after their manifestation they speak and are illuminated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9816.mp3	in regard to this question theologians and materialists disagree the theologians believe that christ was born of the holy spirit but the materialists think this is impossible and inadmissible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9817.mp3	and that without doubt he had a human father in the qur'an it is said and we sent our spirit unto her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9818.mp3	and he addressed mary the materialists believe that there must be marriage and say that a living body cannot be created from a lifeless body and without male and female there cannot be fecundation and they think that not only with man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9819.mp3	and of everything have we created two kinds that is to say we have created all the beings through pairing briefly they say a man without a human father cannot be imagined
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9820.mp3	in answer the theologians say this thing is not impossible and unachievable but it has not been seen and there is a great difference between a thing which is impossible and one which is unknown for example
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9821.mp3	in former times the telegraph which causes the east and the west to communicate was unknown but not impossible photography and phonography were unknown but not impossible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9822.mp3	the materialists insist upon this belief and the theologians reply is this globe eternal or phenomenal the materialists answer that according to science and important discoveries it is established that it is phenomenal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9823.mp3	in the beginning it was a flaming globe and gradually it became temperate a crust was formed around it and upon this crust plants came into existence then animals and finally man the theologians say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9824.mp3	is not the creation of man without father and mother even though gradually more difficult than if he had simply come into existence without a father as you admit that the first man came into existence without father or mother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9825.mp3	whether it be gradually or at once there can remain no doubt that a man without a human father is also possible and admissible you cannot consider this impossible otherwise you are illogical for example
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9826.mp3	if you say that this lamp has once been lighted without wick and oil and then say that it is impossible to light it without the wick this is illogical christ had a mother the first man as the materialists believe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9827.mp3	the greatness of christ is due to his perfections a great man is a great man whether born of a human father or not if being without a father is a virtue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9828.mp3	which can be compared to father and mother and it is absolute perfection but the darkness has neither substance nor form neither father nor mother and it is absolute imperfection the substance of adam's physical life was earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9829.mp3	but the substance of abraham was pure sperm it is certain that the pure and chaste sperm is superior to earth furthermore in the first chapter of the gospel of john verses twelve and thirteen it is said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9830.mp3	even to them that believed on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9831.mp3	also is not created by physical power but by the spiritual reality the honor and greatness of christ is not due to the fact that he did not have a human father but to his perfections bounties and divine glory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9832.mp3	if the greatness of christ is his being fatherless then adam is greater than christ for he had neither father nor mother it is said in the old testament and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9833.mp3	and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9834.mp3	moreover the expression which john uses in regard to the disciples proves that they also are from the heavenly father hence it is evident that the holy reality meaning the real existence of every great man comes from god
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9835.mp3	and owes its being to the breath of the holy spirit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9836.mp3	for he had neither father nor mother is it better for a man to be created from a living substance or from earth certainly it is better if he be created from a living substance but christ was born and came into existence from the holy spirit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9837.mp3	pothier seems to think that property like royalty exists by divine right he traces back its origin to god himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9838.mp3	principium he begins in this way god is the absolute ruler of the universe and all that it contains domini
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9839.mp3	for the human race he has created the earth and all its creatures and has given it a control over them subordinate only to his own thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9840.mp3	thou hast put all things under his feet says the psalmist god accompanied this gift with these words addressed to our first parents after the creation be fruitful and multiply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9841.mp3	are fathers unnatural and children prodigal god gave the earth to the human race why then have i received none he has put all things under my feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9842.mp3	and i have not where to lay my head multiply he tells us through his interpreter pothier ah learned pothier that is as easy to do as to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9843.mp3	but you must give moss to the bird for its nest the human race having multiplied men divided among themselves the earth and most of the things upon it that which fell to each
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9844.mp3	from that time exclusively belonged to him that was the origin of the right of property say rather the right of possession men lived in a state of communism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9845.mp3	whether positive or negative it matters little then there was no property not even private possession the genesis and growth of possession gradually forcing people to labor for their support
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9846.mp3	they agreed either formally or tacitly it makes no difference which that the laborer should be sole proprietor of the fruit of his labor that is they simply declared the fact
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9847.mp3	that thereafter none could live without working it necessarily followed that to obtain equality of products there must be equality of labor and that to obtain equality of labor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9848.mp3	there must be equality of facilities for labor whoever without labor got possession by force or by strategy of another's means of subsistence destroyed equality
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9849.mp3	whoever violated it was unjust thus labor gives birth to private possession the right in a thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9850.mp3	but in what thing evidently in the product not in the soil so the arabs have always understood it and so according to caesar and tacitus the germans formerly held the arabs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9851.mp3	who admit a man's property in the flocks which he has raised do not refuse the crop to him who planted the seed but they do not see why another his equal should not have a right to plant in his turn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9852.mp3	the inequality which results from the pretended right of the first occupant seems to them to be based on no principle of justice and when all the land falls into the hands of a certain number of inhabitants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9853.mp3	there results a monopoly in their favor against the rest of the nation to which they do not wish to submit well they have shared the land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9854.mp3	and that this method of distribution fixed and durable is advantageous to production but how could this division give to each a transferable right of property in a thing to which
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9855.mp3	all had an inalienable right of possession
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9856.mp3	this metamorphosis from possessor to proprietor is legally impossible it implies in the jurisdiction of the courts the union of possessoire and petitoire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9857.mp3	and the mutual concessions of those who share the land are nothing less than traffic in natural rights the original cultivators of the land who were also the original makers of the law were not as learned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9858.mp3	into the right of absolute property but why have not those who in later times have established the distinction between jus in re and jus ad rem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9859.mp3	applied it to the principle of property itself let me call the attention of the writers on jurisprudence to their own maxims the right of property provided it can have a cause can have but one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9860.mp3	dominium non potest nisi ex una causa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9861.mp3	i can possess by several titles i can become proprietor by only one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9862.mp3	to me as my share but none of these titles confer upon me the right of property for if i attempt to base it upon occupancy society can reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9863.mp3	i am the original occupant if i appeal to my labor it will say it is only on that condition that you possess if i speak of agreements it will respond
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9864.mp3	these agreements establish only your right of use such however are the only titles which proprietors advance they never have been able to discover any others indeed every right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9865.mp3	it is pothier who says it supposes a producing cause in the person who enjoys it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9866.mp3	in this son of earth who passes away like a shadow there exists with respect to external things only titles of possession not one title of property why then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9867.mp3	has society recognized a right injurious to itself where there is no producing cause why in according possession has it also conceded property why has the law sanctioned this abuse of power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9868.mp3	some philosophers pretend that man in employing his forces upon a natural object say a field or a tree acquires a right only to the improvements which he makes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9869.mp3	to the form which he gives to the object not to the object itself useless distinction if the form could be separated from the object perhaps there would be room for question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9870.mp3	but as this is almost always impossible the application of man's strength to the different parts of the visible world is the foundation of the right of property the primary origin of riches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9871.mp3	vain pretext if the form cannot be separated from the object nor property from possession possession must be shared in any case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9872.mp3	society reserves the right to fix the conditions of property let us suppose that an appropriated farm yields a gross income of ten thousand francs and as very seldom happens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9873.mp3	the possessor of this farm should be obliged to guard his reputation as a good father of a family by paying to society ten thousand francs less the total costs of cultivation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9874.mp3	and the three thousand francs required for the maintenance of his family this payment is not rent it is an indemnity what sort of justice is it then which makes such laws as this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9875.mp3	whereas since labor so changes the form of a thing that the form and substance cannot be separated without destroying the thing itself either society must be disinherited
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9876.mp3	or the laborer must lose the fruit of his labor and whereas in every other case property in raw material would give a title to added improvements minus their cost
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9877.mp3	and whereas in this instance property in improvements ought to give a title to the principal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9878.mp3	shall never be admitted against individuals but only against society in such a way do legislators always reason in regard to property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9879.mp3	the law is intended to protect men's mutual rights that is the rights of each against each and each against all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9880.mp3	the law makers always disregard the latter as long as man is opposed to man property offsets property and the two forces balance each other as soon as man is isolated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9881.mp3	that is opposed to the society which he himself represents jurisprudence is at fault themis has lost one scale of her balance listen to the professor of rennes the learned toullier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9882.mp3	possession agriculture was a natural consequence of the multiplication of the human race and agriculture in its turn favors population and necessitates the establishment of permanent property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9883.mp3	for who would take the trouble to plough and sow if he were not certain that he would reap to satisfy the husbandman it was sufficient to guarantee him possession of his crop admit even that he should have been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9884.mp3	protected in his right of occupation of land as long as he remained its cultivator that was all that he had a right to expect that was all that the advance of civilization demanded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9885.mp3	but property property the right of escheat over lands which one neither occupies nor cultivates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9886.mp3	who pretended to have it agriculture alone was not sufficient to establish permanent property positive laws were needed and magistrates to execute them in a word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9887.mp3	the civil state was needed the multiplication of the human race had rendered agriculture necessary the need of securing to the cultivator the fruit of his labor made permanent property necessary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9888.mp3	and also laws for its protection so we are indebted to property for the creation of the civil state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9889.mp3	a state which at first was despotism then monarchy then aristocracy today democracy and always tyranny without the ties of property it never would have been possible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9890.mp3	to subordinate men to the wholesome yoke of the law and without permanent property the earth would have remained a vast forest let us admit then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9891.mp3	it is the civil law which holds that when once acquired property can be lost only by the action of the proprietor and that it exists even after the proprietor has relinquished possession of the thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9892.mp3	and it has fallen into the hands of a third party thus property and possession which originally were confounded became through the civil law two distinct and independent things two things which in the language of the law
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9893.mp3	have nothing whatever in common in this we see what a wonderful change has been effected in property and to what an extent nature has been altered by the civil laws thus the law in establishing property
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9894.mp3	the development of a natural law the application of a moral principle it has literally created a right outside of its own province it has realized an abstraction a metaphor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9895.mp3	it has indorsed monstrous pretensions it has received with favor impious vows as if it were able to fill up a bottomless pit

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9959.mp3	who have become obsessed with the idea of obtaining universal peace by some cheap patent panacea there has been a real and substantial growth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9960.mp3	in the feeling for international responsibility and justice among the great civilized nations during the past threescore or fourscore years there has been a real growth of recognition of the fact
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9961.mp3	and that in most cases war is an evil method of settling international difficulties but as yet there has been only a rudimentary beginning of the development of international tribunals of justice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9962.mp3	and there has been no development at all of any international police power now as i have already said the whole fabric of municipal law of law within each nation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9963.mp3	rests ultimately upon the judge and the policeman and the complete absence of the policeman and the almost complete absence of the judge in international affairs prevents there being as yet any real homology
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9964.mp3	between municipal and international law moreover the questions which sometimes involve nations in war are far more difficult and complex than any questions that affect merely individuals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9965.mp3	almost every great nation has inherited certain questions either with other nations or with sections of its own people which it is quite impossible in the present state of civilization to decide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9966.mp3	as matters between private individuals can be decided during the last century at least half of the wars that have been fought have been civil and not foreign wars there are big and powerful nations which habitually commit either upon other nations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9967.mp3	or upon sections of their own people wrongs so outrageous as to justify even the most peaceful persons in going to war there are also weak nations so utterly incompetent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9968.mp3	either to protect the rights of foreigners against their own citizens or to protect their own citizens against foreigners that it becomes a matter of sheer duty for some outside power to interfere in connection with them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9969.mp3	as yet in neither case is there any efficient method of getting international action and if joint action by several powers is secured the result is usually considerably worse than if only one power interfered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9970.mp3	the worst infamies of modern times such affairs as the massacres of the armenians by the turks for instance have been perpetrated in a time of nominally profound international peace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9971.mp3	when there has been a concert of big powers to prevent the breaking of this peace although only by breaking it could the outrages be stopped be it remembered that the peoples who suffered by these hideous massacres who saw their women violated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9972.mp3	otherwise they would not have been massacred for if the jews in russia and the armenians in turkey had been armed and had been efficient in the use of their arms no mob would have meddled with them

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9975.mp3	because it is expensive this is precisely like arguing that we should disband the police and devote our sole attention to persuading criminals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9976.mp3	suppose that burglary highway robbery and white slavery are profitable it is almost useless to attempt to argue with these well intentioned persons because they are suffering under an obsession and are not open to reason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9977.mp3	they go wrong at the outset for they lay all the emphasis on peace and none at all on righteousness they are not all of them physically timid men but they are usually men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9978.mp3	from insulting or wronging the people of other nations but they always ardently advocate that we in our turn shall tamely submit to wrong and insult from other nations

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9985.mp3	the chief trouble comes from the entire inability of these worthy people to understand that they are demanding things that are mutually incompatible when they demand peace at any price and also justice and righteousness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9986.mp3	i remember one representative of their number who used to write little sonnets on behalf of the mahdi and the sudanese these sonnets setting forth the need that the sudan should be both independent and peaceful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9987.mp3	as a matter of fact the sudan valued independence only because it desired to war against all christians and to carry on an unlimited slave trade
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9988.mp3	under the mahdi for a dozen years and during those dozen years the bigotry tyranny and cruel religious intolerance were such as flourished in the seventh century and in spite of systematic slave raids
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9989.mp3	the population decreased by nearly two thirds and practically all the children died peace came well being came freedom from rape and murder and torture and highway robbery and every brutal gratification of lust and greed came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9990.mp3	only when the sudan lost its independence and passed under english rule yet this well meaning little sonneteer sincerely felt that his verses were issued in the cause of humanity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9991.mp3	looking back from the vantage point of a score of years probably every one will agree that he was an absurd person but he was not one whit more absurd than most of the more prominent persons who advocate disarmament by the united states

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9994.mp3	is the panacea for all ills but in their particular case they are able to do harm because they affect our relations with foreign powers so that other men pay the debt which they themselves have really incurred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/9995.mp3	it is the foolish peace at any price persons who try to persuade our people to make unwise and improper treaties or to stop building up the navy but if trouble comes and the treaties are repudiated

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10186.mp3	so far i have been dealing with our general outfit and shall now pass to the special equipment of the shore party the hut we took out was built on my property on bundefjord so that i was able to watch the work as it progressed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10187.mp3	it was built by the brothers hans and joergen stubberud and was throughout a splendid piece of work which did honour to both the brothers the materials proved excellent in every way the hut was twenty six feet long by thirteen feet wide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10188.mp3	its height from the floor to the ridge of the roof was about twelve feet it was built as an ordinary norwegian house with pointed gable and had two rooms one of these was nineteen and a half feet long and was to serve as our dormitory dining room and sitting room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10189.mp3	the other room was six and a half feet long and was to be lindstroem's kitchen from the kitchen a double trap door led to the loft where we intended to keep a quantity of provisions and outfit the walls consisted of three inch planks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10190.mp3	for insulation we used cellulose pulp the floor and the ceiling between the rooms and the loft were double
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10191.mp3	the doors were extraordinarily thick and strong and fitted into oblique grooves so that they closed very tightly there were two windows a triple one in the end wall of the main room and a double one in the kitchen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10192.mp3	for the covering of the roof we took out roofing paper and for the floor linoleum in the main room there were two air pipes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10193.mp3	there were bunks for ten men in two stages six on one wall and four on the other the furniture of the room consisted of a table a stool for each man and a lux lamp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10194.mp3	the hut was tarred several times and every part was carefully marked so that it could easily be set up to fasten it to the ground and prevent the antarctic storms from blowing it away i had strong eyebolts screwed into each end of the roof ridge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10195.mp3	and the four corners of the roof we carried six strong eyebolts a metre long to be rammed into the barrier between these bolts and those on the hut steel wires were to be stretched which could be drawn quite tight we also had two spare cables
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10196.mp3	which could be stretched over the roof if the gales were too severe the two ventilating pipes and the chimney were secured outside with strong stays as will be seen every precaution was taken to make the hut warm and comfortable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10197.mp3	and to hold it down on the ground we also took on board a quantity of loose timber boards and planks besides the hut we took with us fifteen tents for sixteen men each ten of these were old but good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10198.mp3	they were served out to us from the naval stores the other five were new and we bought them from the army depots it was our intention to use the tents as temporary houses they were easily and quickly set up and were strong and warm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10199.mp3	on the voyage to the south roenne sewed new floors of good strong canvas to the five new tents all cases of provisions that were intended for winter quarters were marked and stowed separately in the hold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10200.mp3	we had ten sledges made by a firm of sporting outfitters in christiania they were built like the old nansen sledges but rather broader and were twelve feet long the runners were of the best american hickory shod with steel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10201.mp3	the other parts were of good tough norwegian ash to each sledge belonged a pair of spare runners which could easily be fitted underneath by means of clamps and as easily removed when not required
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10202.mp3	the steel shoeing of the runners was well coated with red lead and the spare runners with tar these sledges were extremely strongly built and could stand all kinds of work on every sort of surface at that time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10203.mp3	i did not know the conditions on the barrier as i afterwards came to know them of course these sledges were very heavy we took twenty pairs of ski all of the finest hickory they were eight feet long and proportionately narrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10204.mp3	i chose them of this length with a view to being able to cross the numerous cracks in the glaciers the greater the surface over which the weight could be distributed the better prospect we should have of slipping over the snow bridges
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10205.mp3	we had forty ski poles with ebonite points the ski bindings were a combination of the huitfeldt and the hoeyer ellefsen bindings we also had quantities of loose straps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10206.mp3	we had six three man tents all made in the navy workshops the workmanship could not have been better they were the strongest and most practical tents that have ever been used they were made of the closest canvas with the floor in one piece
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10207.mp3	one man was sufficient to set up the tent in the stiffest breeze i have come to the conclusion that the fewer poles a tent has the easier it is to set up which seems quite natural these tents have only one pole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10208.mp3	how often one reads in narratives of polar travel that it took such and such a time often hours to set up the tent and then when at last it was up one lay expecting it to be blown down at any moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10209.mp3	there was no question of this with our tents they were up in a twinkling and stood against all kinds of wind we could lie securely in our sleeping bags and let it blow the arrangement of the door was on the usual sack principle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10210.mp3	which came from the estate of palsgaard in jutland and the material did all it promised these cases were one foot square and fifteen and a half inches high
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10211.mp3	they had only a little round opening on the top closed with an aluminium lid which fitted exactly like the lid of a milk can large lids weaken the cases and i had therefore chosen this form we did not have to throw off the lashing of the case to get the lid off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10212.mp3	and this is a very great advantage we could always get at it a case with a large lid covered by the lashing gives constant trouble the whole lashing has to be undone for every little thing one wants out of the case this is not always convenient
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10213.mp3	if one is tired and slack it may sometimes happen that one will put off till to morrow what ought to be done to day especially when it is bitterly cold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10214.mp3	the handier one's sledging outfit the sooner one gets into the tent and to rest and that is no small consideration on a long journey our outfit of clothing was abundant and more complete i suppose than that of any former polar expedition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10215.mp3	we may divide it into two classes the outfit for specially low temperatures and that for more moderate temperatures it must be remembered that no one had yet wintered on the barrier so we had to be prepared for anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10216.mp3	in order to be able to grapple with any degree of cold we were supplied with the richest assortment of reindeer skin clothing we had it specially thick medium and quite light it took a long time to get these skin clothes prepared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10217.mp3	first the reindeer skins had to be bought in a raw state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10218.mp3	let me take the opportunity of thanking this man for the many and great services he has rendered me not only during my preparations for the third voyage of the fram
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10219.mp3	with his help i have succeeded in obtaining things that i should otherwise never have been able to get he shrank from no amount of work but went on till he had found what i wanted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10220.mp3	this time he procured nearly two hundred and fifty good reindeer skins dressed by the lapps and sent them to christiania here i had great trouble in finding a man who could sew skins but at last i found one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10221.mp3	we then went to work to make clothes after the pattern of the netchelli eskimo and the sewing went on early and late thick anoraks and thin ones heavy breeches and light winter stockings and summer stockings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10222.mp3	we also had a dozen thin sleeping bags which i thought of using inside the big thick ones if the cold should be too severe everything was finished but not until the last moment the outer sleeping bags were made by mister brandt furrier of bergen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10223.mp3	and they were so excellent both in material and making up that no one in the world could have done better it was a model piece of work to save this outer sleeping bag we had it provided with a cover of the lightest canvas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10224.mp3	which was a good deal longer than the bag itself it was easy to tie the end of the cover together like the mouth of the sack and this kept the snow out of the bag during the day's march
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10225.mp3	in this way we always kept ourselves free from the annoyance of drifting snow we attached great importance to having the bags made of the very best sort of skin and took care that the thin skin of the belly was removed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10226.mp3	as of course the cold penetrates more easily through the thin skin and gives rise to dampness in the form of rime on meeting the warmth of the body these thin patches remain damp whenever one is in the bag and in a short time they lose their hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10227.mp3	the damp spreads like decay in wood and continually attacks the surrounding skin with the result that one fine day you find yourself with a hairless sleeping bag
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10228.mp3	our burberry wind clothes were made in the form of anorak blouse and trousers both very roomy the others consisted of trousers and jacket with hood our mits were for the most part such as one can buy in any shop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10229.mp3	we wanted nothing else in and around winter quarters outside the mits we wore an outer covering of windproof material so as not to wear them out too quickly these mits are not very strong though they are good and warm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10230.mp3	besides these we had ten pairs of ordinary kid mits which were bought at a glove shop in christiania and were practically impossible to wear out i wore mine from framheim to the pole and back again and afterwards on the voyage to tasmania
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10231.mp3	the lining of course was torn in places but the seams of the mits were just as perfect as the day i bought them taking into consideration the fact that i went on ski the whole way and used two poles it will be understood that the mits were strongly made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10232.mp3	we also had a number of woollen gloves which curiously enough the others greatly prized for myself i was never able to wear such things they simply freeze the fingers off me but most important of all is the covering of the feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10233.mp3	for the feet are the most exposed members and the most difficult to protect one can look after the hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10234.mp3	and this is a sufficiently troublesome piece of work to make one disinclined to undo it again until one is turning in they cannot be seen in the course of the day and one has to depend entirely on feeling but feeling in this case often plays curious tricks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10235.mp3	for if they had known it they could not possibly have let it go so far the fact is that in this case sensation is a somewhat doubtful guide for the feet lose all sensation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10236.mp3	it is true that there is a transitional stage when one feels the cold smarting in one's toes and tries to get rid of it by stamping the feet as a rule this is successful the warmth returns or the circulation is restored
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10237.mp3	but it occasionally happens that sensation is lost at the very moment when these precautions are taken and then one must be an old hand to know what has happened many men conclude that as they no longer feel the unpleasant smarting sensation all is well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10238.mp3	and at the evening inspection a frozen foot of tallow like appearance presents itself an event of this kind may ruin the most elaborately prepared enterprise and it is therefore advisable in the matter of feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10239.mp3	to carry one's caution to lengths which may seem ridiculous now it is a fact that if one can wear soft foot gear exclusively the risk of frost bite is far less than if one is compelled to wear stiff boots in soft foot gear of course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10240.mp3	the foot can move far more easily and keep warm but we were to take ski and to get full use out of them so that in any case we had to have a stiff sole for the sake of the bindings it is of no use to have a good binding unless you can use it in the right way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10241.mp3	in my opinion on a long journey such as that we had before us the ski must be perfectly steady i do not know anything that tires me more than a bad fastening that is one that allows the foot to shift in the binding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10242.mp3	i want the ski to be a part of oneself so that one always has full command of them i have tried many patents for i have always been afraid of a stiff fastening in cold temperatures but all these patents without exception are worthless in the long run
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10243.mp3	i decided this time to try a combination of stiff and soft foot gear so that we could use the splendid huitfeldt hoeyer ellefsen bindings but this was no easy matter of our whole outfit nothing caused me more worry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10244.mp3	or gave us all more work in the course of the expedition than the stiff outer covering which we had to have but we solved the problem at last i applied to one of the leading makers of ski boots in christiania and explained the difficulty to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10245.mp3	fortunately i had found a man who was evidently interested in the question we agreed that he should make a sample pair after the pattern of ski boots the sole was to be thick and stiff for we had to be prepared to use crampons but the uppers as soft as possible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10246.mp3	in order to avoid leather which usually becomes stiff and easily cracked in the cold he was to use a combination of leather and thin canvas for the uppers leather nearest the sole and canvas above it the measurements were taken from my foot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10247.mp3	which is not exactly a child's foot with two pairs of reindeer skin stockings on and ten pairs were made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10248.mp3	they were exhibited in the bootmaker's windows i used to go a long way round to avoid coming face to face with these monsters in public we are all a trifle vain and dislike having our own shortcomings shown up in electric light
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10249.mp3	if i had ever cherished any illusions on the subject of a dainty little foot i am sure the last trace of such vanity died out on the day i passed the shoemaker's window and beheld my own boots
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10250.mp3	i never went that way again until i was certain that the exhibition was closed one thing is certain that the boots were a fine piece of workmanship we shall hear later on of the alterations they had to undergo before we at last made them as large as we wanted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10251.mp3	for the giant boots turned out much too small among other equipment i must mention our excellent primus cooking apparatus this all came complete from a firm in stockholm for cooking on sledge journeys the primus stove ranks above all others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10252.mp3	it gives a great deal of heat uses little oil and requires no attention advantages which are important enough anywhere but especially when sledging there is never any trouble with this apparatus it has come as near perfection as possible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10253.mp3	we took five nansen cookers with us this cooker utilizes the heat more completely than any other but i have one objection to make to it it takes up space we used it on our depot journeys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10254.mp3	but were unfortunately obliged to give it up on the main southern journey we were so many in a tent and space was so limited that i dared not risk using it if one has room enough it is ideal in my opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10255.mp3	we had with us ten pairs of snow shoes and one hundred sets of dog harness of the alaska eskimo pattern the alaska eskimo drive their dogs in tandem the whole pull is thus straight ahead in the direction the sledge is going
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10256.mp3	and this is undoubtedly the best way of utilizing the power i had made up my mind to adopt the same system in sledging on the barrier another great advantage it had was that the dogs would pass singly across fissures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10257.mp3	so that the danger of falling through was considerably reduced the exertion of pulling is also less trying with alaska harness than with the greenland kind as the alaska harness has a shallow padded collar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10258.mp3	which is slipped over the animal's head and makes the weight of the pull come on his shoulders whereas the greenland harness presses on his chest raw places which occur rather frequently with the greenland harness are almost entirely avoided with the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10259.mp3	all the sets of harness were made in the navy workshops and after their long and hard use they are as good as ever there could be no better recommendation than this of instruments and apparatus for the sledge journeys we carried two sextants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10260.mp3	three artificial horizons of which two were glass horizons with dark glasses and one a mercury horizon and four spirit compasses made in christiania they were excellent little compasses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10261.mp3	i had drawn the maker's attention to this beforehand and asked him to use as pure a spirit as possible what his object was i still do not know but the spirit he employed was highly dilute
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10262.mp3	the best proof of this was that the liquid in our compasses froze before the spirits in a flask we were naturally inconvenienced by this besides these we had an ordinary little pocket compass two pairs of binoculars one by zeiss and the other by goertz
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10263.mp3	and snow goggles from doctor schanz
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10264.mp3	during the whole stay on the barrier i myself wore a pair of ordinary spectacles with yellow glasses of quite a light tint
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10265.mp3	how excellent these glasses are appears clearly enough from the fact that i never had the slightest touch of snow blindness on the southern journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10266.mp3	it will perhaps be suggested that i am less susceptible to this ailment than others but i know from personal experience that such is not the case i have previously had several severe attacks of snow blindness we had two photographic cameras an air thermometer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10267.mp3	two aneroids with altitude scale to fifteen thousand feet and two hypsometers the hypsometer is only an instrument for determining the boiling point which gives one the height above the sea the method is both simple and reliable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10268.mp3	the medical stores for sledging were given by a london firm and the way in which the things were packed speaks for the whole outfit there is not a speck of rust on needles scissors knives or anything else although they have been exposed to much damp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10269.mp3	our own medical outfit which was bought in christiania and according to the vendor's statement unusually well packed became in a short time so damaged that the whole of it is now entirely spoilt the sledging provisions must be mentioned briefly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10270.mp3	i have already spoken of the pemmican i have never considered it necessary to take a whole grocer's shop with me when sledging the food should be simple and nourishing and that is enough a rich and varied menu is for people who have no work to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10271.mp3	besides the pemmican we had biscuits milk powder and chocolate the biscuits were a present from a well known norwegian factory and did all honour to their origin they were specially baked for us and were made of oatmeal with the addition of dried milk and a little sugar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10272.mp3	they were extremely nourishing and pleasant to the taste thanks to efficient packing they kept fresh and crisp all the time these biscuits formed a great part of our daily diet and undoubtedly contributed in no small degree to the successful result
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10273.mp3	milk powder is a comparatively new commodity with us but it deserves to be better known it came from the district of jaederen neither heat nor cold dryness nor wet could hurt it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10274.mp3	we had large quantities of it lying out in small thin linen bags in every possible state of the weather the powder was as good the last day as the first we also took dried milk from a firm in wisconsin this milk had an addition of malt and sugar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10275.mp3	and was in my opinion excellent it also kept good the whole time the chocolate came from a world renowned firm and was beyond all praise the whole supply was a very acceptable gift
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10276.mp3	one hot summer day a few months after the marriage juliet returning to the consulate after a morning spent in very active exercise upon a tennis court was met on the doorstep by dora the youngest of the clarency butchers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10277.mp3	who was awaiting her approach in a high state of excitement hurry up juliet she cried as soon as she could make herself heard you'll never guess what there is for you something you don't often get what is it said juliet coming up the steps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10278.mp3	guess a present no at least i suppose not but there may be one inside inside oh then it's a parcel asked juliet good humouredly she felt a mild curiosity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10279.mp3	which she from the advanced age of twenty three could not look upon as particularly exciting no not a parcel cried dora dancing round her it's a letter there now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10280.mp3	then why do you say it's something i don't often get asked juliet suspiciously i often get letters it's an invitation to the gertignes dance i expect no no it isn't it's a letter from england
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10281.mp3	it's very good of you to take such an interest in my fate juliet replied as she pulled off her gloves and went to the side table for the letter as a matter of fact she was a good deal excited now for what the child said was true enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10282.mp3	she might even have gone further and said that she had never had a letter from england except while sir arthur was there on leave it was a large envelope addressed in a clerk's handwriting and she came to the conclusion as she tore it open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10283.mp3	that it must be an advertisement from some shop dear madam we shall esteem it a favour if you can make it convenient to call upon us one day next week upon a matter of business connected with a member of your family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10284.mp3	it is impossible to give you further details in a letter but if you will grant us the interview we venture to ask
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10285.mp3	to be a reasonable probability of the result being of advantage to yourself trusting that you will let us have an immediate reply in which you will kindly name the day and hour when we may expect to see you we are yours faithfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10286.mp3	solicitors the address was a street in holborn juliet read the letter through and straightway read it through again with a beating heart what did it mean was it possible she was going to find her own family at last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10287.mp3	she was recalled to the present by the voice of dora whom she now perceived to be reading the letter over her shoulder with unblushing interest say said dora isn't it exciting something to your advantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10288.mp3	just what they put in the agony column when they leave you a fortune i bet your long lost uncle in the west has kicked the bucket and left you all his ill gotten gains mark my words you'll come back from england a lovely heiress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10289.mp3	i do wish the others would come in there's no one in the house except sir arthur where is he said juliet putting the sheet of paper back into the envelope and slipping it under her waistband you know dora
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10290.mp3	i wonder you aren't ashamed of yourself i'm surprised at you i shouldn't have read it if you'd been quicker about telling me what was in it retorted dora it's not at all a nice thing to put temptation in the way of a little girl like me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10291.mp3	do you suppose i'm made of cast iron she departed with an injured air and juliet went to look for the consul what is it he asked as she put the envelope into his hand a letter you want me to read not a proposal eh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10292.mp3	hullo what's this he read it through carefully why juliet he said when he had finished this is very interesting isn't it it looks as if you were going to find out something about yourself doesn't it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10293.mp3	after all these years well well you think i must go then she said a little doubtfully go of course i should go if i were you why not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10294.mp3	no no i see no reason to suppose such a thing i know the firm of findlay and ince quite well by name and reputation oh i hope they will tell me who i am cried juliet have you no idea at all father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10295.mp3	no my dear you know i have not besides i promised lena i would never ask you are the child of a friend of hers that is all i know i think she scarcely realized how hard it would be for you not to know more when you grew up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10296.mp3	i often think that if she had lived she would have told you before now if you promised her not to ask i won't ask either said juliet loyally but i hope they'll tell me it will be different won't it if they tell me without my asking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10297.mp3	i think you might ask said sir arthur it is absurd that you should be bound by a promise that i made and you may be sure of one thing your asking or your not asking won't make any odds to findlay and ince
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10298.mp3	if they mean to tell you they will and if they don't you're not likely to get it out of them and when shall i go cried juliet they say they want me to answer immediately you know oh well i don't know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10299.mp3	in a few days you will hardly be ready to start to morrow will you i could be ready easily said juliet you're in a great hurry to get away from us said sir arthur with a rather uneasy laugh not from you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10300.mp3	juliet put her arm through his i could never find another father half as nice as the one i've got but you could do very well without so many daughters you know she smiled at him mockingly you're like the old woman who lived in a shoe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10301.mp3	you ought to set up a school for young ladies i don't believe i shall be able to get on without my eldest daughter he replied half serious still i think it would be better for you if your real parents have decided to own up to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10302.mp3	at all events if they do not turn out desirable i shall still be here i hope so i don't see how you can lose anything by taking this chance of finding out what you can about them at this point lady byrne came into the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10303.mp3	the letter was produced again and she joined heartily in the excitement it had caused you had better start on monday she said to juliet that will give you two days to pack
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10304.mp3	are you going to take her arthur she added turning to her husband i would like a shot he replied but i can't possibly get away next week i've got a lot of work on hand just now i suppose my dear he suggested doubtfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10305.mp3	that you wouldn't be able to run over with her lady byrne declared that it was impossible for her to do so she had engagements she said for every day of the following week which it was out of the question to break
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10306.mp3	had sir arthur forgotten that they themselves were having large dinner parties on tuesday and friday what she would do without juliet to help her in preparing for them she did not know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10307.mp3	but at least it was obvious that some one must be there to receive his guests no juliet would have to go alone she was really old enough to be trusted by herself for three days and there was no need that she could see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10308.mp3	she can go on monday see the lawyers on tuesday and come back on wednesday said lady byrne the helplessness of young girls is the one thing i disapprove of in your european system of education
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10309.mp3	supposing she is detained in london he said what should detain her demanded his wife unless it is the discovery of her parents and if she finds them i presume they will be capable of looking after her in any case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10310.mp3	she can write or cable to us when she has seen the solicitors and it is no use providing for contingencies that will probably never arise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10311.mp3	a letter was written and dispatched to messrs findlay and ince saying that miss byrne would have pleasure in calling upon them at twelve o'clock on the following tuesday and juliet busied herself in preparations for her journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10312.mp3	on monday morning she left ostend in the company of her maid it was a glorious august day on shore the heat was intense and it was a relief to get out of the stifling carriages of the crowded boat train
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10313.mp3	and to breathe the gentle air from the sea that met them as they crossed the gangway on to the steamer juliet enjoyed every moment of the journey and would have been sorry when the crossing was over if she had not been so eager to set foot upon her native soil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10314.mp3	she leant upon the rail in the bows of the ship watching the white cliffs grow taller and more distinct and felt that now indeed she understood the emotions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10315.mp3	with which the heart of the exile is said to swell at the sight of his own land she wondered if the sight of their country moved other passengers on the boat as she herself was moved and made timid advances to a lady who was standing near her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10316.mp3	have you been away from england a long time she asked her i have been abroad during a considerable period replied the person she addressed a stern looking scotchwoman who did not appear anxious to enter into conversation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10317.mp3	from her severe demeanour juliet imagined she might be a governess going for a holiday you must be glad to be going home she ventured it's a far cry north to my home said the scotchwoman thawing slightly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10318.mp3	there may even be a scotchman among the porters you know by some chance no fear said her neighbour gloomily they'll be local men i have nae doubt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10319.mp3	which is one of the bonniest things you see on the continent to my way of thinking juliet could get no enthusiasm out of her and look which way she might she could not see any reflection on the faces of those around her of the emotions which stirred in her own breast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10320.mp3	it had been a rough crossing in spite of the cloudless sky and broiling sunshine and most of the passengers had been laid low by the rolling of the vessel they displayed anxiety enough to reach land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10321.mp3	no doubt she thought when the ship stopped and they felt better they would be more disposed to a sentimentality like hers she found her maid who had been one of the most sea sick of those aboard and assisted her ashore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10322.mp3	put her into a carriage and ministered to her wants with the help of a tea basket containing the delicious novelty of english bread and butter in half an hour's time they were steaming hurriedly towards london she was to lodge at a small hotel in jermyn street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10323.mp3	she was young strong and healthy and there was no reason that trifling discomforts of this kind should affect her enjoyment to the shortcomings of the bed indeed she shut her eyes in more senses than one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10324.mp3	for she was asleep three minutes after her head touched the pillow nor did she wake till her maid roused her the next morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10325.mp3	over the roofs of the houses opposite she could see a blue streak of sky already the air had lost the touch of freshness which comes even to london in august during the first hours of the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10326.mp3	and the heat in the low ceilinged room on the third floor which juliet occupied for the sake of economy was oppressive in spite of the small sash windows being opened to their utmost capacity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10327.mp3	but juliet only laughed to herself with pleasure at the brilliancy of the day she felt that the weather was playing up to the occasion as became this important morning of her life for that it was important she did not doubt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10328.mp3	she was going to hear tremendous news that day make wonderful discoveries about her birth hear undreamt of things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10329.mp3	and it would not have astonished her to find herself claimed as daughter by any of the reigning families of europe she was prepared for anything or so she said to herself however astounding and that being so she was excited in proportion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10330.mp3	anyone could have told her that by this attitude of mind towards the future she was laying up for herself disappointment at the least if not the bitterest disillusions but there was no one to throw cold water on her hopes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10331.mp3	and she filled the air with castles of every style of architecture that her fancy suggested without any hindrance from doubt or misgiving she dressed quickly in the gayest humour but with even more care than she usually bestowed upon her appearance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10332.mp3	scandalized at the idea of such a precious garment being put on before breakfast that very one juliet assured her undaunted and was arrayed in it in spite of obvious disapproval after breakfast they went out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10333.mp3	and inquiring their way to bond street flattened their noses against the shop windows to their mutual satisfaction they had it almost to themselves for there were not many people left in that part of london
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10334.mp3	but more than one head was turned to gaze at the pretty girl in the garden party dress who stood transfixed before shop after shop this amusement lasted till half past eleven when they returned to the hotel for juliet to give the final pats to her hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10335.mp3	before she started to keep her appointment with the solicitors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10336.mp3	with her white paint and her scarlet smokestack the inverashiel one of the two small steamers that during the summer months plied up and down the loch and incidentally carried on communication between inverashiel and crianan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10337.mp3	was a picturesque addition to the landscape as she approached the wooden landing stage that stood half a mile below the promontory on which the castle was built it was the morning of friday the day following the funeral
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10338.mp3	in spite of the brilliant sunset of the previous evening the loch lay dark and still its surface wore an oily treacherous look every detail of the inverashiel's tub like shape was reflected and beautifully distorted in the water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10339.mp3	as the few passengers who were waiting for her crossed the short gangway a shower burst over the loch and in a few minutes had driven every one into the little cabin except the two or three men who constituted the officers and crew of the steamer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10340.mp3	one of these was in the act of slackening the rope by which the boat had been warped alongside when a running gesticulating figure appeared in the distance shouting to them to wait for him waited for accordingly he was and in a few minutes gimblet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10341.mp3	rather out of breath after his run hurried on board and with a word of apology and thanks to the obliging skipper turned like the other passengers towards the shelter of the cabin with his hand on the knob of the door he hesitated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10342.mp3	through the glass top he had just caught sight of a figure that seemed familiar he had seen that tweed before the short girl with her back to him was wearing the dress in which he had seen her on the wednesday night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10343.mp3	searching among lord ashiel's papers in the library at the castle it was julia romaninov beyond a doubt and gimblet drew back quickly and took up his position behind the funnels on the after deck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10344.mp3	in spite of the rain he remained there until the boat reached crianan leaning against the rail with his collar turned up and his soft felt hat pulled down over his ears so that little of him was visible except the tip of his nose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10345.mp3	his mind always active was busier than usual as he watched the ripples roll away in endless succession from the sides of the inverashiel which looked so strangely less white on closer inspection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10346.mp3	or followed the smooth soaring movements of the gulls that swooped and circled around her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10347.mp3	as they drew near to crianan he concealed himself still more carefully behind a pile of crates and not till miss romaninov had left the steamer did he emerge from his hiding place and step warily off the boat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10348.mp3	the young lady was still in sight making her way up the steep pitch of the main street and the detective followed her discreetly loitering before shop windows as if fascinated by the display of scottish homespuns

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10350.mp3	did not apparently provide her with any food for suspicion and she made no attempt to see who was so carefully sheltered beneath the umbrella he carried at last they left the cobble stones of the little town and emerged upon the high road
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10351.mp3	which here ran across the open moorland it was difficult now to continue the pursuit unobserved and gimblet became absorbed in the contemplation of an enormous cairngorm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10352.mp3	which was masquerading as an article of personal adornment in the window of the last outlying shop from this position not without its embarrassments since a couple of barefooted children came instantly to the door where they stood and stared at him unblinkingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10353.mp3	he saw the russian advancing at a rapid pace across the moor and look where he would could perceive no means of keeping up with her unobserved upon the bare side of the hill just as he decided that the distance separating them had increased to an extent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10354.mp3	which warranted his continuing the chase he joyfully saw her slacken her pace and at the same moment a man who must have been sitting behind a boulder beside the road rose to his feet out of the heather and came forward to meet her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10355.mp3	for ten long minutes they stood talking driving poor gimblet to the desperate expedient of entering the shop and demanding a closer acquaintance with the cairngorm it is humiliating to relate that he recoiled before it when it was placed in his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10356.mp3	and nearly fled again into the road however he pulled himself together and held the proud proprietress a gaunt grey haired woman with knitting needles ever clicking in her dexterous hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10357.mp3	in conversation upon the theme of its unique beauties until the subject was exhausted to the point of collapse every other minute he must stroll to the door and take a look up and down the road a friend he explained had promised to meet him in that place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10358.mp3	and though the shopwoman plainly doubted his veracity and kept a sharp eye that he did not take to his heels with the cairngorm she did not go so far as to suggest his removing himself from the zone of temptation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10359.mp3	at last when for the twentieth time he put his nose round the doorpost he saw that the pair had separated and were walking in opposite directions the girl continuing on her way while the man returned to the town
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10360.mp3	he was indeed not a hundred yards off gimblet plunged once more into the shop and fastened upon some pencils with a zeal not very convincing after his disappointing vacillation over the brooch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10361.mp3	which she pressed upon him as particularly suited to his needs and charged him fourpence for by the time he issued forth into the open air his pockets full of packages the stranger had passed the shop and was turning the corner of the next house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10362.mp3	to him now gimblet devoted his powers of shadowing there was no great difficulty about it the man walked straight before him looking neither to the right nor to the left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10363.mp3	narrow pointed footprints that were deeply impressed in the muddy places he had no doubt they were the same as those he had noticed on the beach on the day of his arrival at inverashiel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10364.mp3	the stranger turned into the crianan hotel which stands on the lake front fifty yards from the landing place of the loch steamers gimblet passed the door without pausing and went down to the loch where he mingled with the boatmen and loafers who congregated by the waterside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10365.mp3	he kept however a strict eye on the door of the hotel and after a quarter of an hour saw the object of his attentions emerge with fishing rod and basket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10366.mp3	but now he had a good look as he passed close beside him he was a tall fair man evidently a foreigner but with nothing very striking about his appearance a pointed yellow beard hid the lower part of his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10367.mp3	and for the rest his nose was short his eyes blue and close together and his forehead high and narrow he looked closely at gimblet as he went by and for a moment the eyes of the two men met
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10368.mp3	both equally inscrutable and unflinching then the stranger glanced aside and strode on to where a small boat lay moored the detective turned his back while the fair man got in and pushed off into the loch gentleman going fishing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10369.mp3	he's axtra fond o the feeshin was the reply for a that he's a foreign shentleman waiting till the boat had become a distant speck on the face of the waters gimblet made his way into the inn and entered into conversation with the landlord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10370.mp3	on the pretext of engaging rooms for a friend the landlord was sorry but the house was full
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10371.mp3	folks tak their rooms a month in advance they come here for the fishin on the loch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10372.mp3	indeed i can well believe that gimblet assured him i suppose you get a lot of tourists passing through though americans for instance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10373.mp3	i seldom hae an american bidin here they maistly gang doon the loch said the innkeeper i thought said gimblet that was a foreign looking man whom i saw a little while ago coming out of the hotel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10374.mp3	a polish gintleman he is count pretovsky a vary nice gintleman i couldna just cae him a tourist he's vary keen on the fishin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10375.mp3	a great many sporting foreigners come to our island nowadays gimblet remarked does he get many fish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10376.mp3	dear me said gimblet just what my friend wants i'm sorry you can't take him in i must tell him to write in good time next year if he wants a room as he parted from the landlord upon the doorstep of the crianan hotel the rob roy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10377.mp3	the second of the two loch steamers was edging away from the pier under a cloud of black smoke from her funnel the rain had stopped the passengers were scattered on the deck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10378.mp3	and in the bows of the vessel the detective caught sight of julia romaninov's tweed clad form she was leaning against the rail and gazing at a distant part of the loch where a black speck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10379.mp3	it was as gimblet had expected and though he chafed at the delay he regretted less than he would have otherwise that he could not catch the rob roy the inverashiel would be due on her homeward trip in a couple of hours time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10380.mp3	and meanwhile he had other business that must be attended to he went first to the post office where he registered and posted to scotland yard a packet he had brought with him then after asking his way of the sociable landlord of the hotel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10381.mp3	he proceeded to the police station a single storied stone building standing at the end of a side street here he made himself known to the inspector and imparted information which made that personage open his eyes considerably wider than was his custom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10382.mp3	if you will bring one of your men and come with me yourself said gimblet at the conclusion of the interview
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10383.mp3	in the meantime there will be no harm done by a watch being kept on the foreign gentleman who is at this moment trolling for salmon on the loch the inspector agreed and when the inverashiel started an hour later on her voyage down the loch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10384.mp3	she carried the two policemen on her deck as well as the most notorious detective she was ever likely to have the privilege of conveying it was nearly three o'clock when they landed on the inverashiel pier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10385.mp3	the weather which for the last few hours had looked like clearing had now turned definitely to rain clouds had descended on the hills and the trees in the valleys stooped and dripped in the saturated mist laden air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10386.mp3	gimblet conducted the men to the cottage where lady ruth anxiously awaited them if you don't mind their staying here he suggested to her while i go up to the castle and consult lord ashiel about a magistrate it will be most convenient on account of the distance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10387.mp3	by all means said lady ruth i feel safer with them i expect you will find miss byrne up there she has not come in to lunch and i think she probably met mark and went to lunch at the castle she ought to know better than to go to lunch alone with a young man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10388.mp3	and i am just wondering if she has changed her mind and accepted him after all girls are kittle cattle but i've got quite fond of that one and i hope she's not forgotten poor david so soon i really am feeling anxious about her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10389.mp3	so then all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo cyrus harding could not be mistaken as during the war of the union he had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10390.mp3	or some other material of the same nature that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome the bottom of the brig crushed in and she had sunk instantly the damage done to her hull
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10391.mp3	the speedy had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would have destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing boat yes all was explained everything except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10392.mp3	and i say this in order that ayrton may be acquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these two years who this beneficent stranger is whose intervention has so fortunately for us been manifested on many occasions i cannot imagine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10393.mp3	what his object can be in acting thus in concealing himself after rendering us so many services i cannot understand but his services are not the less real
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10394.mp3	and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of prodigious power could render them ayrton is indebted to him as much as we are for if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall from the balloon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10395.mp3	that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the island which permitted you to land that it was he who fired that bullet found in the body of the peccary that it was he who plunged that torpedo into the channel which destroyed the brig
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10396.mp3	in a word that all those inexplicable events for which we could not assign a reason are due to this mysterious being therefore whoever he may be whether shipwrecked or exiled on our island we shall be ungrateful if we think ourselves freed from gratitude towards him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10397.mp3	we have contracted a debt and i hope that we shall one day pay it you are right in speaking thus my dear cyrus replied gideon spilett yes there is an almost all powerful being hidden in some part of the island
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10398.mp3	and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony i will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which border on the supernatural if in the events of practical life the supernatural were recognizable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10399.mp3	is it he who is in secret communication with us by the well in granite house and has he thus a knowledge of all our plans was it he who threw us that bottle when the vessel made her first cruise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10400.mp3	was it he who threw top out of the lake and killed the dugong was it he who as everything leads us to believe saved you from the waves and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have been able to act if it was he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10401.mp3	he possesses a power which renders him master of the elements the reporter's reasoning was just and every one felt it to be so yes rejoined cyrus harding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10402.mp3	if the intervention of a human being is not more questionable for us i agree that he has at his disposal means of action beyond those possessed by humanity there is a mystery still but if we discover the man the mystery will be discovered also the question then is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10403.mp3	what is your opinion on the matter my opinion said pencroft is that whoever he may be he is a brave man and he has my esteem be it so answered harding but that is not an answer pencroft
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10404.mp3	master then said nebraska my idea is that we may search as long as we like for this gentleman whom you are talking about but that we shall not discover him till he pleases that's not bad what you say nebraska observed pencroft
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10405.mp3	i am of neb's opinion said gideon spilett but that is no reason for not attempting the adventure whether we find this mysterious being or not we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10406.mp3	and you my boy give us your opinion said the engineer turning to herbert oh cried herbert his countenance full of animation how i should like to thank him he who saved you first and who has now saved us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10407.mp3	of course my boy replied pencroft so would i and all of us i am not inquisitive but i would give one of my eyes to see this individual face to face it seems to me that he must be handsome tall strong with a splendid beard radiant hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10408.mp3	but pencroft answered spilett you are describing a picture of the creator possibly mister spilett replied the sailor but that is how i imagine him and you ayrton asked the engineer captain harding replied ayrton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10409.mp3	you are our companion you have already endangered your life several times for us and you as well as the rest ought to be consulted in the matter of any important decision speak therefore captain harding replied ayrton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10410.mp3	i too as you said have a debt of gratitude to pay him it was he it could be only he who must have come to tabor island who found there the wretch you knew and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10411.mp3	therefore it is thanks to him that i have become a man again no i will never forget him that is settled then said cyrus harding we will begin our researches as soon as possible we will not leave a corner of the island unexplored
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10412.mp3	we will search into its most secret recesses and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our intentions for several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and the harvest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10413.mp3	before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into execution they wished to get all possible work finished it was also the time for collecting the various vegetables from the tabor island plants all was stowed away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10414.mp3	and happily there was no want of room in granite house in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island the products of the colony were there methodically arranged and in a safe place as may be believed sheltered as much from animals as from man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10415.mp3	there was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by pick axe or mine and granite house thus became a general warehouse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10416.mp3	containing all the provisions arms tools and spare utensils in a word all the stores of the colony as to the guns obtained from the brig they were pretty pieces of ordnance which at pencroft's entreaty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10417.mp3	were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys right up into granite house embrasures were made between the windows and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff from this height they commanded all union bay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10418.mp3	it would be a good thing if we tried the range of our guns do you think that is useful asked the engineer it is more than useful it is necessary without that how are we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10419.mp3	try them pencroft replied the engineer however i think that in making the experiment we ought to employ
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10420.mp3	but the pyroxyle which will never fail us can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle asked the reporter who was not less anxious than pencroft to try the artillery of granite house i believe so however added the engineer we will be prudent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10421.mp3	the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as possible and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity now said harding to his companions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10422.mp3	the initial velocity is in proportion to the quantity of powder used in the fabrication of these pieces everything depends on employing a metal with the highest possible power of resistance and steel is incontestably that metal of all others which resists the best
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10423.mp3	i have therefore reason to believe that our guns will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas and will give excellent results we shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them answered pencroft
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10424.mp3	it is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order since they had been taken from the water the sailor had bestowed great care upon them how many hours he had spent in rubbing greasing and polishing them and in cleaning the mechanism
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10425.mp3	and now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the united states navy on this day therefore in presence of all the members of the colony including master jup and top the four cannon were successively tried
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10426.mp3	they were charged with pyroxyle taking into consideration its explosive power which as has been said is four times that of ordinary powder the projectile to be fired was cylindroconic pencroft holding the end of the quick match
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10427.mp3	such a shot the honor of which belonged to his dear boy the third shot aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side of union bay struck the sand at a distance of four miles then having ricocheted was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10428.mp3	for the fourth piece cyrus harding slightly increased the charge so as to try its extreme range then all standing aside for fear of its bursting the match was lighted by means of a long cord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10429.mp3	a tremendous report was heard but the piece had held good and the colonists rushing to the windows saw the shot graze the rocks of mandible cape nearly five miles from granite house and disappear in shark gulf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10430.mp3	believe me pencroft replied the engineer it would be better not to have to make the experiment well said the sailor what ought to be done with regard to those six villains who are roaming about the island
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10431.mp3	are we to leave them to overrun our forests our fields our plantations these pirates are regular jaguars and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as such
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10432.mp3	turning to his companion ayrton hesitated at first to reply and cyrus harding regretted that pencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question and he was much moved when ayrton replied in a humble tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10433.mp3	he has as much right to speak here as any one yes said gideon spilett but his reserve does him honor and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past certainly mister spilett answered the sailor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10434.mp3	is that your opinion pencroft asked the engineer quite my opinion and before hunting them mercilessly you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10435.mp3	pencroft think of ayrton said herbert taking the sailor's hand he became an honest man again pencroft looked at his companions one after the other he had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10436.mp3	his rough nature could not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who had landed on the island with bob harvey's accomplices the murderers of the crew of the speedy and he looked upon them as wild beasts which ought to be destroyed without delay and without remorse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10437.mp3	you wish to be generous to those villains very well i hope we mayn't repent it what danger shall we run said herbert if we take care to be always on our guard hum observed the reporter who had not given any decided opinion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10438.mp3	they are six and well armed if they each lay hid in a corner and each fired at one of us they would soon be masters of the colony why have they not done so said herbert no doubt because it was not their interest to do it besides we are six also
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10439.mp3	well well replied pencroft whom no reasoning could have convinced let us leave these good people to do what they like and don't think anything more about them come pencroft said nebraska don't make yourself out so bad as all that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10440.mp3	suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you within good range of your guns you would not fire i would fire on him as i would on a mad dog nebraska replied pencroft coldly pencroft said the engineer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10441.mp3	you have always shown much deference to my advice will you in this matter yield to me i will do as you please captain harding answered the sailor who was not at all convinced very well wait
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10442.mp3	and we will not attack them unless we are attacked first thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon although pencroft augured nothing good from it they were not to attack them but were to be on their guard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10443.mp3	after all the island was large and fertile if any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts these wretches might perhaps be reclaimed was it not their interest in the situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10444.mp3	at any rate for humanity's sake alone it would be right to wait the colonists would no longer as before be able to go and come without fear hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10445.mp3	and now six convicts of the worst description perhaps were roaming over their island it was serious certainly and to less brave men it would have been security lost no matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10446.mp3	at herbert's cry pencroft letting his gun fall rushed towards him they have killed him he cried my boy they have killed him cyrus harding and gideon spilett ran to herbert the reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad's heart was still beating
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10447.mp3	he lives said he but he must be carried to granite house that is impossible replied the engineer into the corral then said pencroft in a moment said harding and he ran round the left corner of the palisade
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10448.mp3	there he found a convict who aiming at him sent a ball through his hat in a few seconds before he had even time to fire his second barrel he fell struck to the heart by harding's dagger more sure even than his gun during this time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10449.mp3	gideon spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over the palisade leaped into the enclosure threw down the props which supported the inner door ran into the empty house and soon poor herbert was lying on ayrton's bed in a few moments harding was by his side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10450.mp3	on seeing herbert senseless the sailor's grief was terrible he sobbed he cried he tried to beat his head against the wall neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10451.mp3	without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine he knew a little of everything and several times he had been obliged to attend to wounds produced either by a sword bayonet or shot assisted by cyrus harding he proceeded to render the aid herbert required
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10452.mp3	the reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which herbert lay a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage or to the shock the ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent concussion herbert was deadly pale and his pulse so feeble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10453.mp3	that spilett only felt it beat at long intervals as if it was on the point of stopping these symptoms were very serious herbert's chest was laid bare and the blood having been stanched with handkerchiefs it was bathed with cold water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10454.mp3	he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his last sigh herberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound by which the ball had immediately escaped god be praised said the reporter the ball is not in the body and we shall not have to extract it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10455.mp3	but the heart asked harding the heart has not been touched if it had been herbert would be dead dead exclaimed pencroft with a groan the sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10456.mp3	no pencroft replied cyrus harding no he is not dead his pulse still beats he has even uttered a moan but for your boy's sake calm yourself we have need of all our self possession do not make us lose it my friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10457.mp3	pencroft was silent but a reaction set in and great tears rolled down his cheeks in the meanwhile gideon spilett endeavored to collect his ideas and proceed methodically after his examination he had no doubt that the ball
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10458.mp3	entering in front between the seventh and eighth ribs had issued behind between the third and fourth but what mischief had the ball committed in its passage what important organs had been reached a professional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10459.mp3	and still more so the reporter however he knew one thing this was that he would have to prevent the inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts then to contend with the local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound perhaps mortal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10460.mp3	now what styptics what antiphlogistics ought to be employed by what means could inflammation be prevented at any rate the most important thing was that the two wounds should be dressed without delay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10461.mp3	it did not appear necessary to gideon spilett that a fresh flow of blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid water and compressing their lips the hemorrhage had been very abundant and herbert was already too much enfeebled by the loss of blood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10462.mp3	the reporter therefore thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water herbert was placed on his left side and was maintained in that position he must not be moved said gideon spilett
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10463.mp3	he is in the most favorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate easily and absolute rest is necessary what can't we carry him to granite house asked pencroft no pencroft replied the reporter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10464.mp3	cyrus said he i am not a surgeon i am in terrible perplexity you must aid me with your advice your experience take courage my friend answered the engineer pressing the reporter's hand judge coolly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10465.mp3	think only of this herbert must be saved these words restored to gideon spilett that self possession which he had lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility he seated himself close to the bed cyrus harding stood near
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10466.mp3	pencroft had torn up his shirt and was mechanically making lint spilett then explained to cyrus harding that he thought he ought first of all to stop the hemorrhage but not close the two wounds or cause their immediate cicatrization for there had been internal perforation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10467.mp3	and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest harding approved entirely and it was decided that the two wounds should be dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation and now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10468.mp3	did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against the inflammation which might occur yes they had one for nature had generously lavished it they had cold water that is to say the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10469.mp3	the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases and the one which is now adopted by all physicians cold water has moreover the advantage of leaving the wound in absolute rest and preserving it from all premature dressing a considerable advantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10470.mp3	since it has been found by experience that contact with the air is dangerous during the first days gideon spilett and cyrus harding reasoned thus with their simple good sense and they acted as the best surgeon would have done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10471.mp3	compresses of linen were applied to poor herbert's two wounds and were kept constantly wet with cold water the sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut which was not wanting in things necessary for life maple sugar medicinal plants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10472.mp3	the same which the lad had gathered on the banks of lake grant enabled them to make some refreshing drinks which they gave him without his taking any notice of it his fever was extremely high and all that day and night passed without his becoming conscious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10473.mp3	herbert's life hung on a thread and this thread might break at any moment the next day the twelfth of november the hopes of harding and his companions slightly revived herbert had come out of his long stupor he opened his eyes he recognized cyrus harding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10474.mp3	the reporter and pencroft he uttered two or three words he did not know what had happened they told him and spilett begged him to remain perfectly still telling him that his life was not in danger and that his wounds would heal in a few days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10475.mp3	however herbert scarcely suffered at all and the cold water with which they were constantly bathed prevented any inflammation of the wounds the suppuration was established in a regular way the fever did not increase
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10476.mp3	and it might now be hoped that this terrible wound would not involve any catastrophe pencroft felt the swelling of his heart gradually subside he was like a sister of mercy like a mother by the bed of her child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10477.mp3	herbert dozed again but his sleep appeared more natural tell me again that you hope mister spilett said pencroft tell me again that you will save herbert yes we will save him replied the reporter the wound is serious and perhaps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10478.mp3	even the ball has traversed the lungs but the perforation of this organ is not fatal god bless you answered pencroft as may be believed during the four and twenty hours they had been in the corral the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing herbert
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10479.mp3	they did not think either of the danger which threatened them should the convicts return or of the precautions to be taken for the future but on this day while pencroft watched by the sick bed cyrus harding and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10480.mp3	at the moment he scaled the palisade had clearly seen some one of the convicts running along the southern spur of mount franklin towards whom top had sprung it was one of those whose object had been so completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth of the mercy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10481.mp3	and as he was a man to defend himself he must have been overpowered yes that is to be feared said the reporter then doubtless the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything and only fled when they saw us coming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10482.mp3	it is very evident too that at this moment ayrton whether living or dead is not here we shall have to beat the forest said the engineer and rid the island of these wretches pencroft's presentiments were not mistaken when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10483.mp3	that would have spared us all these misfortunes yes answered the reporter but now we have the right to be merciless at any rate said the engineer we are obliged to wait some time and to remain at the corral until we can carry herbert without danger to granite house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10484.mp3	he must not come returned cyrus harding quickly he would be murdered on the road it is very probable however that he will attempt to rejoin us ah if the telegraph still acted he might be warned but that is impossible now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10485.mp3	as to leaving pencroft and herbert here alone we could not do it well i will go alone to granite house no no cyrus answered the reporter you must not expose yourself your courage would be of no avail the villains are evidently watching the corral
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10486.mp3	they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it and if you go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10487.mp3	it is now four and twenty hours since he has had any news of us he will be sure to come and as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves added spilett he will be killed is there really no way of warning him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10488.mp3	who had understood the engineer top can go where we cannot he will carry to granite house the news of the corral and he will bring back to us that from granite house quick said harding quick spilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note book and wrote these words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10489.mp3	herbert wounded we are at the corral be on your guard do not leave granite house have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood reply by top
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10490.mp3	go go top bounded at these words he understood he knew what was expected of him the road to the corral was familiar to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10491.mp3	top running among the grass or in the wood would pass unperceived the engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10492.mp3	top sprang forwards then almost immediately disappeared he will get there said the reporter yes and he will come back the faithful animal what o'clock is it asked gideon spilett ten
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10493.mp3	in an hour he may be here we will watch for his return the gate of the corral was closed the engineer and the reporter re entered the house herbert was still in a sleep pencroft kept the compresses always wet spilett
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10494.mp3	seeing there was nothing he could do at that moment busied himself in preparing some nourishment while attentively watching that part of the enclosure against the hill at which an attack might be expected the settlers awaited top's return with much anxiety
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10495.mp3	a little before eleven o'clock cyrus harding and the reporter rifle in hand were behind the gate ready to open it at the first bark of their dog they did not doubt that if top had arrived safely at granite house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10496.mp3	the queen was receiv'd at babylon with all the transports of joy that could possibly be express'd for the safe return of so illustrious and so beautiful a personage that had run thro such a long series of misfortunes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10505.mp3	before they could be entitled to the election so that the tournaments were to be continu'd till one of the candidates should be twice a victor and shine as conspicuous with respect to his internal qualities as to his dexterity and address in heroic atchievements
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10506.mp3	the queen in the mean time was to be narrowly watch'd and allow'd only to be a spectator of both their amusements at some considerable distance and moreover to be cover'd with a vail

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10581.mp3	harlow says others will have to know of it of course you see she's just made up her mind to sell it and asked him to find a customer i wouldn't trouble you but he says they're peculiar the daughter especially and may need some careful handling that's why i wanted you

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10583.mp3	that she was one day to be mistress of the strata and all it contained was still anything but common to her i'd love to see it and i'll come gladly but i'm afraid i won't be much help uncle william she worried i'll take the risk of that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10584.mp3	why how funny well i'll come at eleven you say at park street yes and thank you my dear i tried to get kate to go too but she wouldn't by the way i'm going to bring you home to luncheon kate leaves this afternoon you know

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10586.mp3	i'll tell her though and i'll see you at eleven finished billy as she hung up the receiver promptly at the appointed time billy met uncle william at park street and together they set out for the west end street named on the paper in his pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10587.mp3	but when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached the man looked about him with a troubled frown i declare billy i'm not sure but we'd better turn back he fretted i didn't mean to take you to such a place as this billy shivered a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10588.mp3	nonsense uncle william of course you won't turn back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10589.mp3	she finished just above her breath missus greggory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four flights of stairs up which william henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10590.mp3	billy really i think we should turn back but billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes she was missus greggory yes she was even as she uttered the words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10591.mp3	however she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion missus greggory was a cripple her slender little body was poised on two once costly crutches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10592.mp3	both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10593.mp3	mechanically she had taken the chair toward which missus greggory had motioned her she had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10594.mp3	missus greggory had seated herself now and william henshaw had cleared his throat nervously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10595.mp3	we er i came from harlow missus greggory he gave me to understand you had an er teapot that er with his eyes on the cracked white crockery pitcher on the table william henshaw came to a helpless pause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10596.mp3	a curious expression or rather series of expressions crossed missus greggory's face terror joy dismay and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy relief in the end conquered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10597.mp3	though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke the lowestoft yes i'm so glad that is of course i must be glad i'll get it her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10598.mp3	there was only despairing sorrow on her face now the man rose at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10599.mp3	what a beauty missus greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot creamy in tint and exquisitely decorated in a rose design
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10600.mp3	near it set a tray like plate of the same ware and decoration if you'll lift it down please yourself motioned missus greggory i don't like to with these she explained tapping the crutches at her side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10601.mp3	with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation the collector reached for the teapot his eyes sparkled billy look what a beauty and it's a lowestoft too the real thing the genuine true soft paste
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10602.mp3	and there's the tray did you notice he exulted turning back to the shelf you don't see that every day they get separated most generally you know these pieces have been in our family for generations said missus greggory with an accent of pride
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10603.mp3	you'll find them quite perfect i think perfect i should say they were cried the man they are then valuable missus greggory's voice shook indeed they are but you must know that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10604.mp3	i have been told so yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association my mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir again her voice broke william henshaw cleared his throat but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10605.mp3	madam if you do not wish to sell he stopped abruptly his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china missus greggory gave a low cry but i do that is i must
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10606.mp3	and that it will bring in money and we need money she threw a quick glance toward the hall door though she did not pause in her remarks i can't do much at work that pays i sew she nodded toward the machine by the window
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10607.mp3	but with only one foot to make it go you see the other is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10608.mp3	she finished with a wistful whimsicality billy turned away sharply there was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes she was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against she did not know what exactly but she fancied it was against the teapot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10609.mp3	or against uncle william for wanting the teapot or for not wanting it if he did not buy it and so you see i do very much wish to sell missus greggory said then perhaps you will tell me what it would be worth to you she concluded tremulously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10610.mp3	the collector's eyes glowed he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it then he turned to the tray after a moment he spoke i have only one other in my collection as rare he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10611.mp3	i paid a hundred dollars for that i shall be glad to give you the same for this madam missus greggory started visibly a hundred dollars so much as that she cried almost joyously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10612.mp3	brought of course if it's worth that to you she paused suddenly a quick step had sounded in the hall outside the next moment the door flew open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10613.mp3	mother only think i've she stopped and drew back a little her startled eyes went from one face to another then dropped to the lowestoft teapot in the man's hands her expression changed at once she shut the door quickly and hurried forward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10614.mp3	mother what is it who are these people she asked sharply billy lifted her chin the least bit she was conscious of a feeling which she could not name billy was not used to being called these people in precisely that tone of voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10615.mp3	william henshaw too raised his chin he also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people my name is henshaw miss greggory i presume he said quietly i was sent here by mister harlow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10616.mp3	stammered missus greggory wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation this gentleman says he will be glad to buy it er my daughter alice mister henshaw she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and miss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10617.mp3	neilson supplied the man as she looked at billy and hesitated a swift red stained alice greggory's face with barely an acknowledgment of the introductions she turned to her mother yes dear but that won't be necessary now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10618.mp3	as i started to tell you when i came in i have two new pupils and so turning to the man again i thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10619.mp3	william henshaw frowned angrily that was the man but his eyes the collector's eyes sought the teapot longingly before either the man or the collector could speak however missus greggory interposed quick words of remonstrance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10620.mp3	but alice my dear she almost sobbed you didn't wait to let me tell you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10621.mp3	he will give us a hundred dollars a hundred dollars echoed the girl faintly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10622.mp3	billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10623.mp3	billy was wondering which she herself desired more that uncle william should buy the lowestoft or that he should not she knew she wished missus greggory to have the hundred dollars there was no doubt on that point then uncle william spoke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10624.mp3	and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp i am very sorry of course if my offer has annoyed you he said stiffly i certainly should not have made it had i not had missus greggory's assurance that she wished to sell the teapot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10625.mp3	alice greggory turned as if stung wished to sell she repeated the words with superb disdain she was plainly very angry her blue gray eyes gleamed with scorn and her whole face was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10626.mp3	do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she's treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing alice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10627.mp3	i can't help it stormed the girl hotly i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10628.mp3	perhaps they think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darned and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes alice gasped missus greggory in dismayed horror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10629.mp3	with a little outward fling of her two hands alice greggory stepped back her face had grown white again i beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet i should not have spoken so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10630.mp3	you are very kind mister henshaw but i do not think we care to sell the lowestoft to day both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh william henshaw picked up his hat his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10631.mp3	or what to say but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something during the brief minute that he hesitated however billy sprang forward missus greggory please won't you let me buy the teapot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10632.mp3	and then won't you keep it for me here i haven't the hundred dollars with me but i'll send it right away you will let me do it won't you it was an impulsive speech and a foolish one of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10633.mp3	but it was one that might be expected perhaps from billy missus greggory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking dear child she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10634.mp3	even while she shook her head in denial not so her daughter alice greggory flushed scarlet she drew herself proudly erect thank you she said with crisp coldness but distasteful as darns and patches are to us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10635.mp3	we prefer them infinitely to charity oh but please i didn't mean you didn't understand faltered billy for answer alice greggory walked deliberately to the door and held it open oh alice my dear pleaded missus greggory again feebly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10636.mp3	come billy we'll bid you good morning ladies said william henshaw then decisively and billy with a little wistful pat on missus greggory's clasped hands went once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10637.mp3	william henshaw drew a long breath well by jove billy the next time i take you curio hunting it won't be to this place he fumed wasn't it awful choked billy awful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10638.mp3	the girl was the most stubborn unreasonable vixenish little puss i ever saw i didn't want her old lowestoft if she didn't want to sell it but to practically invite me there and then treat me like that scolded the collector his face growing red with anger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10639.mp3	still i was sorry for the poor little old lady i wish somehow she could have that hundred dollars it was the man who said this not the collector so do i rejoined billy dolefully

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10666.mp3	who had long resided in england as ambassador from the united provinces and everard van dykvelt who after the death of charles had been sent by the state general on a special mission of condolence and congratulation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10667.mp3	the king said that he had received from unquestionable sources intelligence of designs which were forming against the throne by his banished subjects in holland some of the exiles were cutthroats
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10668.mp3	whom nothing but the special providence of god had prevented from committing a foul murder and among them was the owner of the spot which had been fixed for the butchery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10669.mp3	argyle has the greatest means of annoying me and of all places holland is that whence a blow may be best aimed against me the dutch envoys assured his majesty that what he had said should instantly be communicated to the government
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10670.mp3	were at this time most desirous that the hospitality of their country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10671.mp3	james had lately held language which encouraged the hope that he would not patiently submit to the ascendancy of france it seemed probable that he would consent to form a close alliance with the united provinces and the house of austria
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10672.mp3	there was therefore at the hague an extreme anxiety to avoid all that could give him offence the personal interest of william was also on this occasion identical with the interest of his father in law
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10673.mp3	but the case was one which required rapid and vigorous action and the nature of the batavian institutions made such action almost impossible the union of utrecht
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10674.mp3	for the purpose of meeting immediate exigencies had never been deliberately revised and perfected in a time of tranquillity every one of the seven commonwealths
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10675.mp3	which that union had bound together retained almost all the rights of sovereignty and asserted those rights punctiliously against the central government
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10676.mp3	as the federal authorities had not the means of exacting prompt obedience from the provincial authorities so the provincial authorities had not the means of exacting prompt obedience from the municipal authorities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10677.mp3	holland alone contained eighteen cities each of which was for many purposes an independent state jealous of all interference from without if the rulers of such a city received from the hague an order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10678.mp3	which was unpleasing to them they either neglected it altogether or executed it languidly and tardily in some town councils indeed the influence of the prince of orange was all powerful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10679.mp3	but unfortunately the place where the british exiles had congregated and where their ships had been fitted out was the rich and populous amsterdam and the magistrates of amsterdam were the heads of the faction hostile to the federal government
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10680.mp3	and to the house of nassau the naval administration of the united provinces was conducted by five distinct boards of admiralty one of those boards sate at amsterdam was partly nominated by the authorities of that city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10681.mp3	and seems to have been entirely animated by their spirit all the endeavours of the federal government to effect what james desired were frustrated by the evasions of the functionaries of amsterdam and by the blunders of colonel bevil skelton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10682.mp3	then instead of applying as he should have done to the states general who sate close to his own door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10683.mp3	with a request that the suspected ships might be detained the magistrates of amsterdam answered that the entrance of the zuyder zee was out of their jurisdiction and referred him to the federal government it was notorious that this was a mere excuse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10684.mp3	and that if there had been any real wish at the stadthouse of amsterdam to prevent argyle from sailing no difficulties would have been made skelton now addressed himself to the states general they showed every disposition to comply with his demand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10685.mp3	departed from the course which they ordinarily observed in the transaction of business on the same day on which he made his application to them an order drawn in exact conformity with his request
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10686.mp3	was despatched to the admiralty of amsterdam but this order in consequence of some misinformation did not correctly describe the situation of the ships they were said to be in the texel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10687.mp3	would in a moment have put an end to his expedition round his little fleet a boat was rowing in which were some persons with telescopes whom he suspected to be spies but no effectual step was taken for the purpose of detaining him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10688.mp3	and on the afternoon of the second of may he stood out to sea before a favourable breeze the voyage was prosperous on the sixth the orkneys were in sight argyle very unwisely anchored off kirkwall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10689.mp3	and allowed two of his followers to go on shore there the bishop ordered them to be arrested the refugees proceeded to hold a long and animated debate on this misadventure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10690.mp3	for from the beginning to the end of their expedition however languid and irresolute their conduct might be they never in debate wanted spirit or perseverance some were for an attack on kirkwall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10691.mp3	some were for proceeding without delay to argyleshire at last the earl seized some gentlemen who lived near the coast of the island and proposed to the bishop an exchange of prisoners the bishop returned no answer and the fleet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10692.mp3	after losing three days sailed away this delay was full of danger it was speedily known at edinburgh that the rebel squadron had touched at the orkneys troops were instantly put in motion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10693.mp3	when the earl reached his own province he found that preparations had been made to repel him at dunstaffnage he sent his second son charles on shore to call the campbells to arms but charles returned with gloomy tidings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10694.mp3	the herdsmen and fishermen were indeed ready to rally round mac callum more but of the heads of the clan some were in confinement and others had fled those gentlemen who remained at their homes were either well affected to the government

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10696.mp3	here the earl published a manifesto drawn up in holland under the direction of the committee by james stewart a scotch advocate whose pen was a few months later employed in a very different way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10697.mp3	in this paper were set forth with a strength of language sometimes approaching to scurrility many real and some imaginary grievances it was hinted that the late king had died by poison

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10783.mp3	she said then she broke off and sat back why did he shoot just then she asked oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother but she was knitting tranquilly then he answered with a curious deliberateness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10784.mp3	i said that braithwaite had done more for the world by one speech than jesus and all his saints put together he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second then they went on again as before

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10797.mp3	but after this well well we have shown that we can shed our blood too it is in the nick of time too just at the crisis i don't want to exaggerate it is only a scratch but it was so deliberate and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10798.mp3	and so dramatic the poor devil could not have chosen a worse moment people won't forget it mabel's eyes shone with pleasure you poor dear she said are you in pain not much besides christ
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10799.mp3	if only this infernal eastern affair would end he knew he was feverish and irritable and made a great effort to drive it down oh my dear he went on flushed a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10800.mp3	if they would not be such heavy fools they don't understand they don't understand yes oliver they don't understand what a glorious thing it all is humanity life truth at last and the death of folly but haven't i told them a hundred times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10801.mp3	she loved to see him like this his confident flushed face the enthusiasm in his blue eyes and the knowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with passion she bent forward and kissed him suddenly my dear i am so proud of you oh oliver he said nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10802.mp3	but she could see what she loved to see that response to her own heart and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet more and the click of the writer in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10803.mp3	oliver stirred presently did you notice anything just now sweetheart when i said that about jesus christ she stopped knitting for a moment said the girl he nodded you saw that too then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10804.mp3	mabel do you think she is falling back oh she is getting old said the girl lightly of course she looks back a little but you don't think it would be too awful she shook her head no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10805.mp3	no my dear you're excited and tired it's just a little sentiment oliver i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her but she hears it everywhere now no she doesn't remember
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10806.mp3	she can't get it out of her head even after fifty years well watch her won't you by the way yes there's a little more news from the east they say felsenburgh's running the whole thing now the empire is sending him everywhere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10807.mp3	tobolsk benares yakutsk everywhere and he's been to australia mabel sat up briskly isn't that very hopeful i suppose so there's no doubt that the sufis are winning but for how long is another question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10808.mp3	besides the troops don't disperse and europe europe is arming as fast as possible i hear we are to meet the powers next week at paris i must go your arm my dear my arm must get well it will have to go with me anyhow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10809.mp3	tell me some more there is no more but it is just as certain as it can be that this is the crisis if the east can be persuaded to hold its hand now it will never be likely to raise it again it will mean free trade all over the world i suppose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10810.mp3	and all that kind of thing but if not well if not there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10811.mp3	these new benninschein explosives will make certain of that but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them absolutely benninschein sold them simultaneously to east and west then he died luckily for him mabel had heard this kind of talk before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10812.mp3	but her imagination simply refused to grasp it a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing there had been no european war within living memory and the eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10813.mp3	now if tales were true entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell the new conditions were unimaginable military experts prophesied extravagantly contradicting one another on vital points
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10814.mp3	the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory there were no precedents with which to compare it it was as if archers disputed as to the results of cordite only one thing was certain that the east had every modern engine and as regards male population
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10815.mp3	half as much again as the rest of the world put together and the conclusion to be drawn from these premisses was not reassuring to england but imagination simply refused to speak the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10816.mp3	founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world felsenburgh's name appeared more frequently than ever otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush nothing suffered very much trade went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10817.mp3	european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual men still built houses married wives begat sons and daughters did their business and went to the theatre for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else they could neither save nor precipitate the situation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10818.mp3	it was on too large a scale occasionally people went mad people who had succeeded in goading their imagination to a height whence a glimpse of reality could be obtained and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness but that was all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10819.mp3	mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch and for a few days did her best but there was nothing that alarmed her the old lady was a little quiet perhaps but went about her minute affairs as usual she asked the girl to read to her sometimes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10820.mp3	she packed his bag with her own hands set out his furs for the swift flight to paris and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction he would be gone three days he said it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10821.mp3	and mabel running upstairs in alarm at the message of the servant found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair it is nothing my dear said the old lady tremulously and she added the description of a symptom or two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10822.mp3	she was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body the old lady was so tranquil and human
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10823.mp3	so absorbed in small external matters so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth so utterly without resentment or peevishness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10824.mp3	she found less difficulty in contemplating the end of a vigorous soul for in that case she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10825.mp3	her whole point so to speak lay in the delicate little fabric of personality built out of fragile things into an entity far more significant than the sum of its component parts the death of a flower reflected mabel is sadder than the death of a lion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10826.mp3	the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace it is syncope said the doctor when he came in she may die at any time she may live ten years there is no need to telegraph for mister brand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10827.mp3	he made a little deprecating movement with his hands it is not certain that she will die it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10828.mp3	she asked no no she may live ten years i said he added a word or two of advice as to the use of the oxygen injector and went away the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10829.mp3	well my dear she asked it is just a little weakness mother you must lie quiet and do nothing shall i read to you no my dear i will think a little it was no part of mabel's idea to duty to tell her that she was in danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10830.mp3	for there was no past to set straight no judge to be confronted death was an ending not a beginning it was a peaceful gospel at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10831.mp3	so the girl went downstairs once more with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still what a strange and beautiful thing death was she told herself this resolution of a chord that had hung suspended for thirty fifty or seventy years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10832.mp3	back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all in all to itself those same notes would be struck again were being struck again even now all over the world though with an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10833.mp3	but that particular emotion was gone it was foolish to think that it was sounding eternally elsewhere for there was no elsewhere she too herself would cease one day let her see to it that the tone was pure and lovely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10834.mp3	mister phillips arrived the next morning as usual just as mabel had left the old lady's room and asked news of her she is a little better i think said mabel she must be very quiet all day the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10835.mp3	where a heap of letters lay to be answered a couple of hours later as mabel went upstairs once more she met mister phillips coming down he looked a little flushed under his sallow skin missus brand sent for me he said she wished to know whether mister oliver would be back to night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10836.mp3	he will will he not you have not heard mister brand said he would be here for a late dinner he will reach london at nineteen and is there any other news he compressed his lips there are rumours he said mister brand wired to me an hour ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10837.mp3	he seemed moved at something and mabel looked at him in astonishment it is not eastern news she asked his eyebrows wrinkled a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10838.mp3	she was not offended for she trusted her husband too well but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating the old lady too seemed excited she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks and hardly smiled at all to the girl's greeting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10839.mp3	said mabel old missus brand looked at her sharply an instant but said nothing don't excite yourself mother oliver will be back to night the old lady drew a long breath don't trouble about me my dear she said i shall do very well now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10840.mp3	he will be back to dinner will he not if the volor is not late now mother are you ready for breakfast mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation it was certain that something had happened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10841.mp3	the secretary who breakfasted with her in the parlour looking on to the garden had appeared strangely excited he had told her that he would be away the rest of the day mister oliver had given him his instructions he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10842.mp3	and he had given her no news of the paris convention he only repeated that mister oliver would be back that night then he had gone of in a hurry half an hour later the old lady seemed asleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10843.mp3	neither did she like to leave the house so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing till the long shadow lay across the path and the tumbled platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10844.mp3	as she came in she took up the evening paper but there was no news there except to the effect that the convention would close that afternoon twenty o'clock came but there was no sign of oliver the paris volor should have arrived an hour before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10845.mp3	but mabel staring out into the darkening heavens had seen the stars come out like jewels one by one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10846.mp3	of course she might have missed it there was no depending on its exact course but she had seen it a hundred times before and wondered unreasonably why she had not seen it now but she would not sit down to dinner and paced up and down in her white dress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10847.mp3	turning again and again to the window listening to the soft rush of the trains the faint hoots from the track and the musical chords from the junction a mile away the lights were up by now and the vast sweep of the towns looked like fairyland between the earthly light
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10848.mp3	and the heavenly darkness why did not oliver come or at least let her know why he did not once she went upstairs miserably anxious herself to reassure the old lady and found her again very drowsy he is not come she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10849.mp3	i dare say he may be kept in paris the old face on the pillow nodded and murmured and mabel went down again it was now an hour after dinner time oh there were a hundred things that might have kept him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10850.mp3	he had often been later than this he might have missed the volor he meant to catch the convention might have been prolonged he might be exhausted and think it better to sleep in paris after all and have forgotten to wire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10851.mp3	he might even have wired to mister phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it there it was that round silent month that little row of labelled buttons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10852.mp3	she half decided to touch them one by one and inquire whether anything had been heard of her husband there was his club his office in whitehall mister phillips's house parliament house and the rest but she hesitated telling herself to be patient
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10853.mp3	oliver hated interference and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety then even as she turned away the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight whitehall she pressed the corresponding button and her hand shaking so much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10854.mp3	that she could scarcely hold the receiver to her ear she listened who is there her heart leaped at the sound of her husband's voice tiny and minute across the miles of wire i mabel she said alone here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10855.mp3	i am back all is well now listen can you hear yes yes the best has happened it is all over in the east felsenburgh has done it now listen i cannot come home to night it will be announced in paul's house in two hours from now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10856.mp3	we are communicating with the press come up here to me at once you must be present can you hear oh yes come then at once it will be the greatest thing in history tell no one come before the rush begins in half an hour the way will be stopped oliver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10857.mp3	yes quick mother is ill shall i leave her how ill oh no immediate danger the doctor has seen her there was silence for a moment yes come then we will go back to night anyhow then

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10859.mp3	it was through this alone that the false unity of the church with its fantastic spiritual fraternity could be counteracted saint paul had been right he declared in his desire to break down the partition walls between nations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10860.mp3	and wrong only in his exaltation of jesus christ thus he had preluded his speech on the poor law question pointing to the true charity that existed among masons apart from religious motive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10861.mp3	and looked out with considerable excitement at the huge throng gathered to hear her son speak a platform was erected round the bronze statue at such a height that the statesman appeared to be one of the speakers though at a slightly higher elevation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10862.mp3	and this platform was hung with roses surmounted by a sounding board and set with a chair and table the whole square round about was paved with heads and resonant with sound the murmurs of thousands of voices
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10863.mp3	overpowered now and again by the crash of brass and thunder of drums as the benefit societies and democratic guilds each headed by a banner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10864.mp3	and converged towards the wide railed space about the platform where room was reserved for them the windows on every side were packed with faces tall stands were erected along the front of the national gallery and saint martin's church
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10865.mp3	garden beds of colour behind the mute white statues that faced outwards round the square from braithwaite in front past the victorians john davidson john burns and the rest round to hampden and de montfort towards the north
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10866.mp3	the old column was gone with its lions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10867.mp3	nor the lions to the new art and in their place stretched a wide pavement broken by slopes of steps that led up to the national gallery overhead the roofs showed crowded friezes of heads against the blue summer sky
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10868.mp3	not less than one hundred thousand persons it was estimated in the evening papers were collected within sight and sound of the platform by noon as the clocks began to tell the hour two figures appeared from behind the statue and came forward and in an instant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10869.mp3	the murmurs of talk rose into cheering old lord pemberton came first a grey haired upright man whose father had been active in denouncing the house of which he was a member on the occasion of its fall over seventy years ago and his son had succeeded him worthily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10870.mp3	and it was he who was to be chairman on this auspicious occasion behind him came oliver bareheaded and spruce and even at that distance his mother and wife could see his brisk movement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10871.mp3	there was no doubt that these londoners could sing it was as if a giant voice hummed the sonorous melody rising to enthusiasm till the music of massed bands followed it as a flag follows a flag stick the hymn was one composed ten years before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10872.mp3	and all england was familiar with it old missus bland lifted the printed paper mechanically to her eyes and saw the words that she knew so well the lord that dwells in earth and sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10873.mp3	had been composed with both skill and ardour they had a religious ring the unintelligent christian could sing them without a qualm yet their sense was plain enough the old human creed that man was all even christ's words themselves were quoted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10874.mp3	the kingdom of god it was said lay within the human heart and the greatest of all graces was charity she glanced at mabel and saw that the girl was singing with all her might with her eyes fixed on her husband's dark figure a hundred yards away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10875.mp3	and his thin metallic voice piped a sentence or two across the tinkling splash of the fountains behind him then he stepped back and oliver came forward it was too far for the two to hear what was said but mabel slipped a paper smiling tremulously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10876.mp3	into the old lady's hand and herself bent forward to listen old missus brand looked at that too knowing that it was an analysis of her son's speech and aware that she would not be able to hear his words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10877.mp3	of this great anniversary then there came a retrospect comparing the old state of england with the present fifty years ago the speaker said poverty was still a disgrace now it was so no longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10878.mp3	it was in the causes that led to poverty that the disgrace or the merit lay who would not honour a man worn out in the service of his country or overcome at last by circumstances against which his efforts could not prevail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10879.mp3	he enumerated the reforms passed fifty years before on this very day by which the nation once and for all declared the glory of poverty and man's sympathy with the unfortunate so he had told them he was to sing the praise of patient poverty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10880.mp3	and its reward and that he supposed together with a few periods on the reform of the prison laws would form the first half of his speech the second part was to be a panegyric of braithwaite treating him as the precursor of a movement that even now had begun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10881.mp3	old missus brand leaned back in her seat and looked about her the window where they sat had been reserved for them two arm chairs filled the space but immediately behind there were others standing very silent now craning forward watching too with parted lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10882.mp3	a couple of women with an old man directly behind and other faces visible again behind them their obvious absorption made the old lady a little ashamed of her distraction and she turned resolutely once more to the square ah he was working up now to his panegyric
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10883.mp3	the tiny dark figure was back a yard nearer the statue and as she looked his hand went up and he wheeled pointing as a murmur of applause drowned for an instant the minute resonant voice then again he was forward half crouching for he was a born actor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10884.mp3	and a storm of laughter rippled round the throng of heads she heard an indrawn hiss behind her chair and the next instant an exclamation from mabel what was that there was a sharp crack and the tiny gesticulating figure staggered back a step
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10885.mp3	the old man at the table was up in a moment and simultaneously a violent commotion bubbled and heaved like water about a rock at a point in the crowd immediately outside the railed space where the bands were massed and directly opposite the front of the platform
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10886.mp3	and now said coronel we'd better decide what to do but i don't mind what we do now said hyacinth happily she may have the throne and father and udo and

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10892.mp3	prince coronel will be staying here said the princess prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both and if they discussed those things in the servants halls of those days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10893.mp3	no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth bless her pretty face had found her man at last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10894.mp3	but i get no assistance from roger at this point he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders i say said coronel as they went up the grand staircase i am not a prince you know don't say i have deceived you

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10899.mp3	he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvane's face she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him why whoever is this she said getting to her feet before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10900.mp3	the princess and coronel were upon them ah countess i thought we should find you together said hyacinth archly let me present to you my friend the duke coronel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10901.mp3	udo is one of my oldest friends he turned and clapped that bewildered highness on the back aren't you udo and i can think of no one more suitable in every way he bowed again and turned back to the prince well udo you're looking splendid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10902.mp3	a different thing countess from when i last saw him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10903.mp3	ah what a miracle worker true love is i think one of the things which made belvane so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10904.mp3	meanwhile udo of course blundered along gaily we aren't exactly princess i mean what are you doing here coronel i didn't know princess that you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10905.mp3	the countess and i were just having a little i was just telling her what you said about how did you get here coronel shall we tell him said coronel with a smile at hyacinth hyacinth nodded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10906.mp3	i rode said coronel it's a secret he added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10907.mp3	explained hyacinth and hearing that there was to be a wedding added coronel belvane made up her mind coronel was evidently a very different man from udo if he stayed in euralia as adviser
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10908.mp3	more than adviser she guessed to hyacinth her own position would not be in much doubt and as for the king it might be months before he came back and when he did come would he remember her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10909.mp3	we didn't want it to be known yet she said shyly but you have guessed our secret your royal highness she looked modestly at the ground and feeling for her reluctant lover's hand went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10910.mp3	udo and i here she squeezed the hand and finding it was coronel's took udo's boldly without any more maidenly nonsense udo and i love each other say something udo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10911.mp3	prompted coronel er yes said udo very unwillingly and deciding he would explain it all afterwards whatever his feelings for the countess he was not going to be rushed into a marriage oh i'm so glad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10912.mp3	said hyacinth i felt somehow that it must be coming because you've seen so much of each other lately wiggs and i have often talked about it together what has happened to the child thought belvane she isn't a child at all she's grown up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10913.mp3	there's no holding udo once he begins volunteered coronel he's the most desperate lover in araby my father will be so excited when he hears said hyacinth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10914.mp3	you know of course that his majesty comes back to morrow with all his army she did not swoon or utter a cry she did not plead the vapours or the megrims
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10915.mp3	she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace she said if your royal highness will excuse me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10916.mp3	and with a curtsey she was gone coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth i'm enjoying this he seemed to say well she announced i must be going in too there'll be much to see about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10917.mp3	and now said the prince tell me what you are doing here coronel put his arm in udo's and walked him up and down the flagged path your approaching marriage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10918.mp3	he said is the talk of araby naturally i had to come here to see for myself what she was like my dear udo she's charming i congratulate you don't be a fool coronel i haven't the slightest intention of marrying her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10919.mp3	there hasn't been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10920.mp3	yes i think you may take our word for it that it's true i haven't the slightest intention what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10921.mp3	oh very well if you're going to drop all your former friends go on then but when i'm married there will always be a place for understand once and for all said udo angrily that i am not getting married no don't take my arm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10922.mp3	we can talk quite well like this i am sorry udo said coronel meekly we seem to have made a mistake but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position it wasn't in the least compromising
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10923.mp3	protested udo indignantly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10924.mp3	ah and who would listen to a hopeless story like that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10925.mp3	once more i am not going to marry her well you must please yourself but you have compromised her severely with that story poor innocent girl well let's forget about it and now tell me how do you like euralia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10926.mp3	said udo stiffly well perhaps you're right i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way udo who was about to enter the palace turned round with a startled look what do you mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10927.mp3	you never told me your precious countess whom you expect me to marry how very unkind of her a nasty person to annoy he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10928.mp3	udo evidently hadn't thought of this he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened she couldn't do anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10929.mp3	yes but of course the chance might come again you'd have the thing hanging over you always she's clever you know and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy lovely flowers aren't they what's the name of this one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10930.mp3	udo dropped undecidedly into a seat this wanted thinking out the countess what was wrong with her after all and she evidently adored him of course that was not surprising the question was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10931.mp3	was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for after all he had been no more gallant than was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman it was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10932.mp3	of course he ought to have left euralia long ago but he had stayed on and well decidedly she was beautiful perhaps he had paid rather too much attention to that and he had certainly neglected the princess a little
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10933.mp3	after all again why not marry the countess it was absurd to suppose there was anything in coronel's nonsense but one never knew not that he was marrying her out of fear no certainly not it was simply a chivalrous whim on his part
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10934.mp3	the poor woman had misunderstood him and she should not be disappointed she seems fond of flowers said coronel you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you now understand clearly coronel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10935.mp3	i'm not in the least frightened by the countess my dear udo what a speech for a lover of course you're not after all what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10936.mp3	i must ask you not to refer to it if i marry the countess you'll be a very lucky man put in coronel i happen to know that the king of euralia however she's chosen you it seems
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10937.mp3	personally i can't make out what she sees in you what is it i should have thought it was quite obvious said udo with dignity well coronel i think perhaps you are right and that it's my duty to marry her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10938.mp3	coronel shook him solemnly by the hand i congratulate your royal highness i will announce your decision to the princess she will be much amu much delighted and he turned into the palace

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10940.mp3	so far as is known this was her only work but she built up some reputation on it and belvane who was a good judge had a high opinion of her genius to be exact there were only four hundred and ninety nine men

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10943.mp3	henry having caught a glimpse of the chief armourer's daughter had accepted without any false pride and had frequently dropped in to supper thereafter now that the war was over he found that he could not tear himself away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10944.mp3	with king merriwig's permission he was settling in barodia and with the chief armourer's permission he was starting on his new life as a married man as the towers of the castle came in sight merriwig drew a deep breath of happiness home again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10945.mp3	were in his pocket days of honoured leisure were waiting for him he gazed at each remembered landmark of his own beloved country his heart overflowing with thankfulness never again would he leave euralia how good to see hyacinth again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10946.mp3	poor little hyacinth left all alone but there she had had the countess belvane a woman of great experience to help her belvane should he risk it how much had she thought of him while he was away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10947.mp3	hyacinth would be growing up and getting married soon life would be lonely in euralia then unless should he risk it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10948.mp3	he must be longing to tell you that oh he'll have a hundred things to tell you first but then when he says and what's been happening here while i've been away nothing much i suppose then you can say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10949.mp3	then i shall say nothing much only coronel and such a clever oh i have my ideas said coronel well i'll be out of the way somewhere i think i'll go for a walk in the forest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10950.mp3	or shall i stay here in the countess's garden and amuse myself with udo anyhow i'll give you an hour alone together first the cavalcade drew up in front of the castle handkerchiefs fluttered to them from the walls trumpets were blown hounds bayed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10951.mp3	down the steps came hyacinth all blue and gold and flung herself into her father's arms my dear child said merriwig as he patted her soothingly there there it's your old father come back again h'r'm there there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10952.mp3	he patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down my little hyacinth my own little girl oh father i am glad to have you back there there my child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10953.mp3	he took a step forward and addressed his troops men of euralia cheers we have returned from a long and arduous conflict cheers to the embraces loud cheers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10954.mp3	of our mothers and wives and daughters prolonged cheering as the case may be hear hear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10955.mp3	in honour of our great victory i decree that from now onwards to morrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout euralia terrific cheering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10956.mp3	here he turned and embraced his daughter again and if his eye travelled over her shoulder in the direction of belvane's garden it is a small matter and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10957.mp3	there was another storm of cheers the battle cry of euralia ho ho merriwig was shouted from five hundred throats and the men dispersed happily to their homes hyacinth and merriwig went into the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10958.mp3	now father said hyacinth later on when merriwig had changed his clothes and refreshed himself you've got to tell me all about it i can hardly believe it's really over yes yes it's all over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10959.mp3	said merriwig heartily we shan't have any trouble in that direction again i fancy do tell me did the king of barodia apologise he did better than that he abdicated why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10960.mp3	well said merriwig remembering just in time i er killed him oh father how rough of you i don't think it hurt him very much my dear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10961.mp3	see i have brought these home for you he produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper oh how exciting whatever can it be merriwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10962.mp3	neatly tied up with blue ribbon father he picked out the left one fons et origo if he had known any latin of the war and held it up for hyacinth's inspection there you can see the place where henry smallnose's arrow bent it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10963.mp3	by the way he added henry is marrying and settling down in barodia it is curious he went on how after a war one's thoughts turn to matrimony he glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10964.mp3	but she was still engrossed with the whiskers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10965.mp3	i can't plant them in the garden i thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in barodia isn't that a little unkind now that the poor man's dead merriwig looked round him to see that there were no eavesdroppers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10966.mp3	can you keep a secret he asked mysteriously of course said hyacinth deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told coronel well then listen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10967.mp3	he told her of his secret journey to the king of barodia's tent he told her of the king of barodia's letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10968.mp3	and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10969.mp3	to hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings and by and by the moment came of which coronel had spoken and now said merriwig
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10970.mp3	nothing much i suppose he waited nervously wondering if hyacinth would realise that all was meant to include more particularly belvane hyacinth drew a stool up to her father's chair and sat down very close to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10971.mp3	father she said stroking his hand where it rested on his knee i have got some news for you nothing about the coun nothing serious i hope said merriwig in alarm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10972.mp3	it's rather serious but it's rather nice father dear would you mind very much if i got married soon my dear you shall get married as soon as you like let me see there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10973.mp3	i sent them off on adventures of some kind but dear me yes they ought to have been back by now i suppose you haven't heard anything of them no father said hyacinth with a little smile ah well no doubt they were unsuccessful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10974.mp3	no matter dear we can easily find you plenty more suitors indeed the subject has been very near my thoughts lately we'll arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighbouring countries there'll be no lack of candidates
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10975.mp3	let me see there's that seven headed bull he's getting a little old now but he was good enough for the last one we might i don't want a suitor said hyacinth softly i have one merriwig leant forward with eagerness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10976.mp3	my dear this is indeed news tell me all about it upon what quest did you send him hyacinth had felt this coming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10977.mp3	what is his income a man must prove his worth in some way i haven't sent him away at all yet she said he's only just come he's been very kind to me and i'm sure you'll love him well well we'll arrange something for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10978.mp3	by the way who is he he comes from araby and his name is udo of course why didn't i think of him an excellent arrangement my dear it isn't udo i'm afraid father it's coronel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10979.mp3	and who might coronel be said the king rather sternly he's he's well he's here he is father she ran up to him impulsively as he came in at the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10980.mp3	oh coronel you're just in time do tell father who you are coronel bowed profoundly to the king before i explain myself your majesty he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10981.mp3	may i congratulate your majesty on your wonderful victory over the barodians from the little i have gathered outside it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred but of course i am longing to hear the full story from your majesty's own lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10982.mp3	is it a fact that your majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of barodia's own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10983.mp3	he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure an adventure after his own heart merriwig was in an awkward position he wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room leave us my child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10984.mp3	he would say these are matters for men to discuss but hyacinth would know quite well why she had been sent out and would certainly tell coronel the truth of the matter afterwards it really looked as if coronel would have to be let into the secret too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10985.mp3	there are certain state reasons he said with dignity why that story has been allowed to get about pardon your majesty i have no wish to but as you know so much you may as well know all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10986.mp3	it happened like this once more he told the story of his midnight visit and of the king's letter to him but your majesty cried coronel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10987.mp3	so you like it said merriwig trying to look modest i love it i knew he'd love it put in hyacinth it's just the sort of story that coronel would love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10988.mp3	tell him about how you fought the king at the beginning of the war and how you pretended to be a swineherd and how could any father have resisted in a little while hyacinth and coronel were seated eagerly at his feet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10989.mp3	and he was telling once more the great story of his adventures well well said the king at the end of it when he had received their tribute of admiration those are just a few of the little adventures that happen in war time he turned to coronel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10990.mp3	and so you i understand wish to marry my daughter does that surprise your majesty well no it doesn't and she i understand wishes to marry you yes please father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10991.mp3	that said coronel simply is much more surprising merriwig however was not so sure of that he liked the look of coronel he liked his manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10992.mp3	and he saw at once that he knew a good story when he heard one of course he said you'll have to win her anything your majesty sets me to do it's as well he added with a disarming smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10993.mp3	that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the king of barodia there is only one man who could have got those truly an excellent young man well we'll arrange something said merriwig looking pleased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10994.mp3	perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor too hyacinth and coronel interchanged a smile alas father she said his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10995.mp3	wait till he has seen them my dear said merriwig with a chuckle he has seen them father what you invited him here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10996.mp3	he came to stay with you and he never his royal highness put in coronel has given his affections to another aha so that's the secret now i wonder if i can guess who she is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10997.mp3	what do you say to the princess elvira of tregong i know his father had hopes in that direction hyacinth looked round at coronel as if appealing for his support he took a step towards her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10998.mp3	no it's not the princess elvira said hyacinth a little nervously the king laughed good humouredly ah well you must tell me he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/train-clean/10999.mp3	hyacinth put out her hand and coronel pressed it encouragingly his royal highness prince udo she said
