https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/0.mp3	shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1.mp3	my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2.mp3	the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/3.mp3	the vine grew outside many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/4.mp3	even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shoplets which had taken root and vegetated somehow though as in an air mercantile of the bleakest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/5.mp3	each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/6.mp3	their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/7.mp3	even in middle age they were still comely and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/8.mp3	the men were as handsome as the women beautiful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/9.mp3	i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/10.mp3	the children were infinite in number and exceedingly merry i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/11.mp3	i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/12.mp3	the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/13.mp3	i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/14.mp3	in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/15.mp3	suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/16.mp3	in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/17.mp3	the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/18.mp3	they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/19.mp3	but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/20.mp3	again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/21.mp3	we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/22.mp3	the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/23.mp3	this had some effect in calming him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/24.mp3	he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/25.mp3	preface to second edition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/26.mp3	this is a mistake though a perfectly natural one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/27.mp3	on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/28.mp3	then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/29.mp3	i regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/30.mp3	i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/31.mp3	but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/32.mp3	i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/33.mp3	it was written in the upper rangitata district of the canterbury province as it then was of new zealand and appeared at christchurch in the press newspaper june thirteenth eighteen sixty three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/34.mp3	i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/35.mp3	i see from my second preface that i took the book to messrs chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/36.mp3	i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the pall mall gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator of april twentieth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/37.mp3	there was also another cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/38.mp3	the first edition of erewhon sold in about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/39.mp3	i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from stereos then made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/40.mp3	i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of erewhon that were repeatedly rewritten but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/41.mp3	this however may not be for the copyright will probably expire in a little over twelve years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/42.mp3	if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedents nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/43.mp3	it will be seen that i did not succeed in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable to reap any pecuniary advantage

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/45.mp3	i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere i was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/46.mp3	sheep and cattle were introduced and bred with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the other till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/47.mp3	i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/48.mp3	i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding ewes they were pretty quiet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/49.mp3	there were a good many sheep which i knew as two or three black ewes and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/50.mp3	it is surprising how soon the eye becomes accustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/51.mp3	it was a monotonous life but it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one is well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/52.mp3	the country was the grandest that can be imagined
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/53.mp3	so lonely and so solemn with the sad grey clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleating upon the mountain side as though its little heart were breaking

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/55.mp3	i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a made man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/56.mp3	there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was any one at all could i hope to cross it

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/161.mp3	the reverend meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror the reverend meekin was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties smoked clay pipes chewed tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/162.mp3	so they went on to the verandah and looked down upon the lights of the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/163.mp3	by and by a short figure smoking a cheroot came up out of the dark and proved to be doctor macklewain who had been prevented from attending the dinner by reason of an accident to a constable at norfolk bay which had claimed his professional attention

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/178.mp3	macklewain shook his head seriously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/179.mp3	he has the strangest fits at times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/180.mp3	unless it's a cancer in the stomach i don't know what it can be cancer in the stomach
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/181.mp3	doctor we all have our crosses have we not

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/192.mp3	this of course was mere bravado on the part of the commandant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/193.mp3	north knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/205.mp3	it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/257.mp3	it was so long that it bushed out behind his ears and made him look like the old portraits i remembered in virginia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/258.mp3	i noticed how white and well shaped his own hands were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/259.mp3	we stood panting on the edge of the ravine looking down at the trees and bushes that grew below us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/260.mp3	the wind was so strong that i had to hold my hat on and the girls skirts were blown out before them

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/266.mp3	we were so deep in the grass that we could see nothing but the blue sky over us and the gold tree in front of us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/267.mp3	after antonia had said the new words over and over she wanted to give me a little chased silver ring she wore on her middle finger

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/270.mp3	in aristocratic communities the people readily give themselves up to bursts of tumultuous and boisterous gayety which shake off at once the recollection of their privations the natives of democracies are not fond of being thus violently broken in upon and they never lose sight of their own selves without regret

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/283.mp3	they stand unmoved in their solitary greatness well assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show themselves off and that no one will attempt to drive them from that position

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/439.mp3	he sat still and passive his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair his hands relaxed upon the arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/440.mp3	his face had a look of weariness and pleasure like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/441.mp3	he made the sign of the cross over me put on his cap and went off in the dark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/442.mp3	they sat about the house most of the day as if it were sunday greasing their boots mending their suspenders plaiting whiplashes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/443.mp3	anyway he would never allow one of his horses to be put to such a strain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/444.mp3	i had wanted to get some picture books for yulka and antonia even yulka was able to read a little now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/445.mp3	she cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/446.mp3	on the white pages i grouped sunday school cards and advertising cards which i had brought from my old country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/447.mp3	when he mounted his horse at the door i saw that he had a hatchet slung to his belt and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/448.mp3	i put on my cap and ran out to meet jake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/449.mp3	he used to help my father cut christmas trees for me in virginia and he had not forgotten how much i liked them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/450.mp3	by the time we had placed the cold fresh smelling little tree in a corner of the sitting room it was already christmas eve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/451.mp3	from under the lining he now produced a collection of brilliantly colored paper figures several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/452.mp3	i can see them now exactly as they looked working about the table in the lamplight jake with his heavy features so rudely moulded that his face seemed somehow unfinished otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted mustache
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/453.mp3	the week following christmas brought in a thaw and by new year's day all the world about us was a broth of gray slush and the guttered slope between the windmill and the barn was running black water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/454.mp3	it was the first time missus shimerda had been to our house and she ran about examining our carpets and curtains and furniture all the while commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious complaining tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/455.mp3	your mama i said angrily wants other people's things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/456.mp3	for ambrosch my mama come here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/457.mp3	but you see a body never knows what traits poverty might bring out in em
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/458.mp3	they began to laugh boisterously when they saw me calling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/459.mp3	you've got a birthday present this time jim and no mistake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/460.mp3	how infinite the wealth of love and hope garnered in these same tiny treasure houses and oh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/461.mp3	what bankrupts in the world we feel when death like some remorseless creditor seizes on all we fondly thought our own the twins
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/462.mp3	the ghoul like fever was not to be braved with impunity and baulked of its prey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/463.mp3	the board not so formidable as she had imagined had inquired into her case and instead of sending her to stoke claypole her husband's buckinghamshire parish as she had dreaded had agreed to pay her rent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/464.mp3	margaret met jem wilson several days after his brothers were seriously ill and heard from him the state of things at his home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/465.mp3	she stopped with her hand on the latch of the wilsons door to still her beating heart and listened to the hushed quiet within
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/466.mp3	she opened the door softly there sat missus wilson in the old rocking chair with one sick death like boy lying on her knee crying without let or pause but softly gently as fearing to disturb the troubled gasping child while behind her old alice let her fast dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin which she was laying out on a board placed on a sort of sofa settee in a corner of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/467.mp3	over the child which yet breathed the father bent watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/468.mp3	is there any chance for the other one think you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/469.mp3	but earnest as the father was in watching the yet living he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead and sprang gently up and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/470.mp3	wishing him said mary in a tone of inquiry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/471.mp3	then the mother lifted up her voice and wept
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/472.mp3	her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/473.mp3	mary and alice drew near the fire and stood in quiet sorrow for some time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/474.mp3	then alice broke the silence by saying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/475.mp3	afore christmas time i was as full as full could be of going home for good and all yo han heard how i've wished it this terrible long time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/476.mp3	but he stayed long there and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/477.mp3	oh jem don't give way so i cannot bear to see you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/478.mp3	he did not speak as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment when her soft hand's touch thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/479.mp3	don't jem please don't whispered she again believing that his silence was only another form of grief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/480.mp3	mary i almost loathe myself when i feel i would not give up this minute when my brothers lie dead and father and mother are in such trouble for all my life that's past and gone and mary as she tried to release her hand you know what makes me feel so blessed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/481.mp3	he remained up stairs until after the early dawn showed mary that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and quiet streets to try and get a little sleep before work hour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/482.mp3	so leaving kind messages to george and jane wilson and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to jem and deciding that she had better not she stepped out into the bright morning light so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/483.mp3	her thoughts ran on jem's manner and words not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day but still she wished he had not put it so plainly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/484.mp3	i cannot think what possesses me that i must always be wanting to comfort him when he's downcast and that i must go meddling wi him to night when sure enough it was his aunt's place to speak to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/485.mp3	i think i cannot go right for i either check myself till i'm downright cross to him or else i speak just natural and that's too kind and tender by half
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/486.mp3	but will he thank me for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/487.mp3	there was something of keen practical shrewdness about her which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple foolish unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which miss simmonds young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/488.mp3	the old leaven infused years ago by her aunt esther fermented in her little bosom and perhaps all the more for her father's aversion to the rich and the gentle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/489.mp3	it was a comfort to her when scolded by miss simmonds to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage to order her gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/490.mp3	but the best of her plans the holiest that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest were those relating to her father her dear father now oppressed with care and always a disheartened gloomy person

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/494.mp3	a loud laugh followed at chunky's expense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/495.mp3	the pony did most of it admitted the lad i just gave him his head and that's all there was to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/496.mp3	walter had gone out with the second guard and the others had gathered around the camp fire for their nightly story telling

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/498.mp3	we've got a hard drive before us and every man must be fit as a fiddle

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/500.mp3	the cowboy did this very thing but within an hour he found himself alone the others having turned in one by one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/501.mp3	the lads found that a pair of blankets had been assigned to each of them with an ordinary wagon sheet doubled for a tarpaulin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/502.mp3	these they spread out on the ground using boots wrapped in coats for pillows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/503.mp3	stacy brown proved the only grumbler in the lot declaring that he could not sleep a wink on such a bed as that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/504.mp3	the horses of the outfit save those that were on night duty and two or three others that had developed a habit of straying had been turned loose early in the evening for animals on the trail are seldom staked down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/505.mp3	in spite of their hard couches the pony riders slept soundly even professor zepplin himself never waking the whole night through
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/506.mp3	stacy grumbled turned over and went to sleep again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/507.mp3	you won't be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that i reckon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/508.mp3	lumpy bates came running toward him not daring to call out for fear of waking the camp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/509.mp3	hi there hissed lumpy filled with indignation that anyone should attempt to mount a pony from the right side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/510.mp3	stacy brown's left leg swung over the saddle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/511.mp3	where are they asked the boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/512.mp3	keep a going and if you're lucky you'll run plumb into them was the jeering answer as the sleepy cowmen spurred their ponies on toward camp muttering their disapproval of taking along a bunch of boys on a cattle drive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/513.mp3	almost before the echoes of his voice had died away a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/514.mp3	grub pi le grub pi le
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/515.mp3	who is the wrangler this morning asked the foreman glancing about at his men

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/517.mp3	he's a fellow who's all the time making trouble isn't he asked stacy innocently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/518.mp3	oh no this kind of a wrangler isn't laughed the foreman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/519.mp3	he's a trouble curer not a troublemaker except for himself

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/522.mp3	we had better start the drive this morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/523.mp3	you'll all be over if you don't have a care
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/524.mp3	looks like a clump of bushes down there but i ain't sure can you make it out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/525.mp3	yes agreed tad that does look like bushes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/526.mp3	don't move around lie perfectly still warned the guide are you hurt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/527.mp3	and that tumble's enough to knock the sense out of a full grown man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/528.mp3	i could not think of allowing any of my charges to take so terrible a risk and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/529.mp3	no i am the lighter of the two urged tad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/530.mp3	i am the one to go after walt if anyone has to i'll go down mister thomas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/531.mp3	master tad is right decided the guide gazing at the two boys approvingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/532.mp3	i protest shouted the professor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/533.mp3	you'd have both of us at the bottom if i left it to you to take care of this end
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/534.mp3	be sure to fasten him securely to the loop before you give the signal to haul up warned the guide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/535.mp3	are you ready yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/536.mp3	he tilted his head to look up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/537.mp3	the movement sent his body swaying giddily from side to side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/538.mp3	cautiously placing a hand against the rocks to steady himself tad wisely concluded that hereafter it would not pay to be too curious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/539.mp3	slowly but steadily the slender line was paid out amid a tense silence on the part of the little group at the top of the canyou
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/540.mp3	after what seemed to them hours a sharp call from the depths reached their ears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/541.mp3	lige quickly made fast the line to a tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/542.mp3	i see him called tad his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/543.mp3	he's so far to the right of me that i can't reach him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/544.mp3	lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree i think it is but he doesn't answer me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/545.mp3	lige leaning over the brink was able to follow the boy's movements by the aid of the thin arc of light made by the torch in tad's hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/546.mp3	but from the cautious movements of the light far below them the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/547.mp3	mebby you think he's having some sort of a picnic down there eh glared lige
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/548.mp3	shall we haul up asked lige making a megaphone of his hands yes haul away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/549.mp3	sure thing answered the boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/550.mp3	nor was his sense of security increased when in shifting his position the torch fell from his grasp the fagots scattering as they slipped down between the limbs of the tree and whirling in ever diminishing circles until finally he heard them clatter on the rocks below
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/551.mp3	he no doubt would bring food of some kind with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/552.mp3	with a shout the boys dashed pell mell to meet the pack train and falling in behind the slow moving burros urged them on with derisive shouts and sundry resounding slaps on the animals flanks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/553.mp3	cold water is the most nourishing thing we've touched since last night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/554.mp3	we did not it must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out laughed tad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/555.mp3	and we've got a surprise for you announced stacy swelling with pride
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/556.mp3	jam exclaimed chunky stretching his neck and eyeing the dish longingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/557.mp3	now fall to young gentlemen directed the professor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/558.mp3	i am free to admit that i am hungry too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/559.mp3	he buried his biscuit under a layer of jam over which he spread a thick coating of honey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/560.mp3	president brown i withdraw my criticism i offer you my humble apologies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/561.mp3	i reckon there are smiled the guide we are in the bear country now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/562.mp3	yes the country is full of caves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/563.mp3	this announcement filled the boys with excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/564.mp3	but i know an old settler who will lend us his dog if it is not out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/565.mp3	supper having been finished the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chat after which admonishing stacy to keep within his tent and not to go borrowing trouble the boys turned in for a sound sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/566.mp3	as yet they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/567.mp3	the boys were now all anxiety to start while the ponies after their sunday rest were almost as full of life as were their owners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/568.mp3	the little animals were becoming more sure footed every day and ned said that before the trip was finished jimmie would be able to walk a slack rope
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/569.mp3	an early start was made so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten o'clock in the forenoon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/570.mp3	a temporary camp was quickly pitched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/571.mp3	the great green field surrounded on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal one for their purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/572.mp3	it was a beautiful race the little indian ponies seeming to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest stretching themselves out to their full lengths and with heads on a level with their backs fairly flew across the great plot of green
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/573.mp3	all agreed that tad's superior horsemanship alone had won the race for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/574.mp3	galloping into camp the boy fetched his sombrero which he carried well out into the field and tossed away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/575.mp3	then bidding the boys ride up near the spot to watch him he drew off some ten rods and wheeling spurred his pony to a run
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/576.mp3	grasping the pommel with the left hand he appeared to dive head first toward the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/577.mp3	they saw his long hair almost brush the grass one of his hands swept down and up and once more tad butler rose standing in his stirrups uttering a cowboy yell as he waved the sombrero on high
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/578.mp3	the boys howled with delight that is all did save stacy brown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/579.mp3	tad is an experienced rider
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/580.mp3	the first time he rode swiftly by it leaning over to look at the hat as he passed holding to the pommel firmly with his left hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/581.mp3	what's that for demanded ned wonderingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/582.mp3	hat too close to me i couldn't get it explained chunky the boys roared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/583.mp3	why don't you move the pony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/584.mp3	once more stacy approached the sombrero his pony running well and as he drew near it they saw him rise in his saddle just as tad butler had done a few minutes before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/585.mp3	at the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup he threw his body sharply to the right reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/645.mp3	the sky was visible through several gaping holes in the roof which was sagging dangerously on its supporting trusses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/646.mp3	the young inventor had just noticed his friend lying pinned beneath a heavy beam nearby

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/651.mp3	and the only truck we had available was in that burning shed the superintendent added bitterly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/652.mp3	anyhow we want to help got a job for us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/653.mp3	within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/654.mp3	the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harkness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/655.mp3	the two girls were as much upset as tom's mother tom laughed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/656.mp3	mister swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/657.mp3	he smiled guiltily as he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/658.mp3	he's a great scientist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/659.mp3	tom nodded unhappily

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/662.mp3	thereafter this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four other things touching my condition the which things it seemed to me that i had not yet made manifest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/663.mp3	which thing being thus there came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known they having been with me at divers times in my trouble were met together for the pleasure of gentle company
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/664.mp3	but when i still spake not one of them who before had been talking with another addressed me by my name saying to what end lovest thou this lady seeing that thou canst not support her presence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/665.mp3	and now that it hath pleased her to deny me this love my master of his great goodness hath placed all my beatitude there where my hope will not fail me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/666.mp3	then those ladies began to talk closely together and as i have seen snow fall among the rain so was their talk mingled with sighs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/667.mp3	and i declare that when i speak thereof love sheds such perfect sweetness over me that if my courage failed not certainly to him my listeners must be all resign'd
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/668.mp3	whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon spirits of love do issue thence in flame which through their eyes who then may look on them pierce to the heart's deep chamber every one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/669.mp3	to her i wend along in whose much strength my weakness is made strong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/670.mp3	so to the road thou shalt be reconciled and find the lady and with the lady love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/671.mp3	the second begins here an angel the third here dear song i know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/672.mp3	the first part is divided into four
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/673.mp3	in the third i say what it is i purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/674.mp3	in the fourth repeating to whom i purpose speaking i tell the reason why i speak to them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/675.mp3	in the second i tell what is understood of her on earth here my lady is desired
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/676.mp3	this second part is divided into two for in the first i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her soul relating some of her virtues proceeding from her soul in the second i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her body narrating some of her beauties here love saith concerning her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/677.mp3	this second part is divided into two for in the one i speak of the eyes which are the beginning of love in the second i speak of the mouth which is the end of love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/678.mp3	he translated at an early age chiefly between eighteen forty five and eighteen forty nine a great number of poems by the italians contemporary with dante or preceding him and among other things he made a version of the whole vita nuova prose and verse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/679.mp3	this book in its original form was received with favour and settled the claim of rossetti to rank as a poetic translator or indeed as a poet in his own right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/680.mp3	the life blood of rhythmical translation is this commandment that a good poem shall not be turned into a bad one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/681.mp3	the only true motive for putting poetry into a fresh language must be to endow a fresh nation as far as possible with one more possession of beauty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/682.mp3	poetry not being an exact science literality of rendering is altogether secondary to this chief law
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/683.mp3	often would he avail himself of any special grace of his own idiom and epoch if only his will belonged to him often would some cadence serve him but for his author's structure some structure but for his author's cadence often the beautiful turn of a stanza must be weakened to adopt some rhyme which will tally and he sees the poet revelling in abundance of language where himself is scantily supplied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/684.mp3	and if you have time it would be a great service to translate the analyses of the poems which i omitted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/685.mp3	on january twenty fifth he wrote many and many thanks for a most essential service most thoroughly performed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/686.mp3	my notes which you have taken the trouble of revising are of course quite paltry and useless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/687.mp3	it is therefore and on all accounts unnecessary to say much more of the work here than it says for itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/688.mp3	throughout the vita nuova there is a strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear in some remote meadow and prepares us to look upon the sea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/689.mp3	a word should be said here of the title of dante's autobiography
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/690.mp3	this has induced some editors of the vita nuova to explain the title as meaning early life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/691.mp3	and at the first it seemed to me that i saw certain faces of women with their hair loosened which called out to me thou shalt surely die after the which other terrible and unknown appearances said unto me thou art dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/692.mp3	and so strong was my phantasy that i wept again in very truth and said with my true voice o excellent soul how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/693.mp3	whereby other ladies who were about the room becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made who indeed was of my very near kindred led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying sleep no longer and be not disquieted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/694.mp3	when being aroused i opened mine eyes and knew that it had been a deception
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/695.mp3	and my hue was such that they look'd at each other and thought of death saying under their breath most tenderly o let us comfort him then unto me what dream was thine that it hath shaken thee so much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/696.mp3	and therewithal such a bewilderment possess'd me that i shut mine eyes for peace and in my brain did cease order of thought and every healthful thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/697.mp3	then saw i many broken hinted sights in the uncertain state i stepp'd into
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/698.mp3	these wildering phantasies then carried me to see my lady dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/699.mp3	the second part begins here i was a thinking the first part divides into two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/700.mp3	this lady's right name was joan but because of her comeliness or at least it was so imagined she was called of many primavera spring and went by that name among them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/701.mp3	and in his speech he laugh'd and laugh'd again then while it was his pleasure to remain i chanced to look the way he had drawn near and saw the ladies joan and beatrice approach me this the other following one and a second marvel instantly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/702.mp3	the second part begins here saying be now the third here then while it was his pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/703.mp3	he lives thy loss he dies from every limb mangled by thee lightnings of godhead shine from which thy darkness hath not where to hide

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/808.mp3	and some of the birds who were attentive and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice homes for themselves

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/882.mp3	the ladies in yellow dresses stand again in a ring about the emperor's daughter and are for the last time accosted by the singer with his lute

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/884.mp3	i'll play for you now neath the apple bough and you shall dream on the lawn so shady lady lady my fair lady o my apple gold lady

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/888.mp3	i don't know what becomes of the ladies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/889.mp3	bed time children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/890.mp3	you see the treatment is a trifle fanciful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/891.mp3	how we must simplify
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/892.mp3	it seems to me more and more as i live longer that most poetry and most literature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/893.mp3	it is the expression of life under cruder and more rigid conditions than ours lived by people who loved and hated more naively aged sooner and died younger than we do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/894.mp3	we range wider last longer and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/895.mp3	and already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events as a thing strange and terrible indeed but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/896.mp3	for a time the death of mary obscured her life for me but now her living presence is more in my mind again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/897.mp3	it was that idea of waste that dominated my mind in a strange interview i had with justin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/898.mp3	i became grotesquely anxious to assure him that indeed she and i had been as they say innocent throughout our last day together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/899.mp3	you were wrong in all that i said she kept her faith with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/900.mp3	we never planned to meet and when we met
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/901.mp3	if we had been brother and sister indeed there was nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/902.mp3	but now it doesn't seem to matter very much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/903.mp3	and it is upon this effect of sweet and beautiful possibilities caught in the net of animal jealousies and thoughtless motives and ancient rigid institutions that i would end this writing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/904.mp3	in mary it seems to me i found both womanhood and fellowship i found what many have dreamt of love and friendship freely given and i could do nothing but clutch at her to make her my possession
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/905.mp3	what alternative was there for her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/906.mp3	she was destroyed not merely by the unconsidered undisciplined passions of her husband and her lover but by the vast tradition that sustains and enforces the subjugation of her sex
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/907.mp3	one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day joseph locked the door of his smithy washed himself well put on clean clothes and taking his violin set out for testbridge mary was expecting him to tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/908.mp3	it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/909.mp3	was there ever a happier man than joseph that night as he strode along the footpath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/910.mp3	he pressed his violin case to his heart as if it were a living thing that could know that he loved it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/911.mp3	earth was gone and heaven was all

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/913.mp3	when he reached the suburbs the light of homes was shining through curtains of all colors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/914.mp3	just then he was in no mood to think of the sorrows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/915.mp3	the nettle and the dock said joseph
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/916.mp3	he was in a mood for music was he not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/917.mp3	he laid down his violin and seated himself where mary told him in her father's arm chair by the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/918.mp3	letty finding herself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turn to call mary she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/919.mp3	the music was broken and joseph left alone with the dumb instruments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/920.mp3	but in his hands solitude and a violin were sure to marry in music
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/921.mp3	they sat down and listened in silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/922.mp3	her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and it was all she could do to keep from weeping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/923.mp3	a little longer and she was compelled to yield and the silent tears flowed freely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/924.mp3	letty too was overcome more than ever she had been by music
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/925.mp3	let but a mood be strong enough and the soul clothing itself in that mood as with a garment can walk abroad and haunt the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/926.mp3	it cried aloud that eternity was very long and like a great palace without a quiet room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/927.mp3	nor was this exactly the shape the thing took to the consciousness of the musician
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/928.mp3	i love thee i love thee cried the violin and the worship was entreaty that knew not itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/929.mp3	hast thou yet to learn that the love of the human is love is divine is but a lower form of a part of the love of god
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/930.mp3	when thou lovest man or woman or child yea or even dog aright then wilt thou no longer need that i tell thee how god and his christ would not be content with each other alone in the glories even of the eternal original love because they could create more love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/931.mp3	he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how shall he love god whom he hath not seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/932.mp3	a sob like a bird new born burst from mary's bosom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/933.mp3	that enchantment had possessed him usurping as it were the throne of his life and displacing it when it ceased he was not his own master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/934.mp3	he started to conscious confusion only neither knowing where he was nor what he did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/935.mp3	how it happened he never could tell but he brought down his violin with a crash against the piano then somehow stumbled and all but fell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/936.mp3	in the act of recovering himself he heard the neck of his instrument part from the body with a tearing discordant cry like the sound of the ruin of a living world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/937.mp3	his violin was broken but his being was made whole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/938.mp3	his treasure taken type of his self and a woman given him instead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/939.mp3	it's just like him he murmured

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/941.mp3	colonel leonidas talbot regarded the white flag with feelings in which triumph and sadness were mingled strangely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/942.mp3	but the emotions of harry and his comrades were for the moment those of victory only
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/943.mp3	boats put out both from the fort and the shore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/944.mp3	the smoke itself which had formed a vast cloud over harbor forts and city was now drifting out to sea leaving all things etched sharply in the dazzling sunlight of a southern spring day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/945.mp3	that white flag and those boats going out mean that sumter is ours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/946.mp3	but the negotiations were soon completed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/947.mp3	all the amenities were preserved between the captured garrison and their captors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/948.mp3	the great state of virginia mother of presidents went out of the union at last and north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed her but maryland kentucky and missouri still hung in the balance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/949.mp3	lincoln had called for volunteers to put down a rebellion but harry heard everywhere in charleston that the confederacy was now secure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/950.mp3	the progress of president davis to the new capital set in the very face of the foe was to be one huge triumph of faith and loyalty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/951.mp3	there was not a single note of gloom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/952.mp3	europe which must have its cotton would favor the success of the south
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/953.mp3	an extraordinary wave of emotion swept over the south carrying everybody with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/954.mp3	beauregard at once wrote an order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/955.mp3	colonel kenton writes wisely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/956.mp3	we need kentucky and i understand that a very little more may bring the state to us go with your father i understand that you have been a brave young soldier here and may you do as well up there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/957.mp3	harry feeling pride but not showing it saluted and left the room going at once to madame delaunay's where he had left his baggage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/958.mp3	he intended to leave early in the morning but first he sought his friends and told them good bye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/959.mp3	harry gave his farewells with deep and genuine regret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/960.mp3	whether their manner was grave or frivolous he knew that these were good friends of his and he sincerely hoped that he would meet them again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/961.mp3	it was a different harry who started home late in april
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/962.mp3	four months had made great changes he bore himself more like a man his manner was much more considered and grave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/963.mp3	he had seen great things and he had done his share of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/964.mp3	he gazed upon a world full of responsibilities and perils
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/965.mp3	but he looked back at charleston the gay the volatile and the beautiful with real affection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/966.mp3	it was almost buried now in flowers and foliage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/967.mp3	he was going home after victory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/968.mp3	he soon left charleston out of sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/969.mp3	he felt the difference as soon as he reached the hills of his native state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/970.mp3	people were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/971.mp3	the air too was unlike that of south carolina there was a sharper tang to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/972.mp3	it whipped his blood as it blew down from the slopes and crests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/973.mp3	it was afternoon when he reached the little station of winton and left the train a tall sturdy boy the superior of many a man in size strength and agility
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/974.mp3	there were never before such times in old kentucky
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/975.mp3	bill skelly an his gang them mountaineers are up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/976.mp3	he did not say the last as a boast but merely as an assurance to the liveryman who he saw was anxious on his account
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/977.mp3	if you've got pistols just you think once before you shoot said collins
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/978.mp3	harry thanked him threw his saddle bags across the horse a powerful bay and giving a final wave of his hand to the sympathetic liveryman rode away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/979.mp3	this was not the fashion of a year ago when they exchanged a friendly word or two but harry knew its cause now nobody could trust anybody else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/980.mp3	but he saw nothing that moved there no signal lights twinkled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/981.mp3	long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/982.mp3	every year at a certain day of a certain month he went away to a distant city to collect money on an account
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/983.mp3	how do you know asked their father i am older and wiser than you are and i know that there are many evils which might come upon you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/984.mp3	when it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchant's house he knocked at the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/985.mp3	have pity upon a poor unfortunate one he called out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/986.mp3	let me enter i pray you to pass the night under your roof
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/987.mp3	it's surely a terrible storm outside said the merchant's eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/988.mp3	he is old as well as poor she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/989.mp3	if we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/990.mp3	bui we should not forget our promise to our father cried the youngest daughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/991.mp3	however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/992.mp3	it is a fearful night to send away a beggar said the eldest sister while they were eating
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/993.mp3	while they were talking the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/994.mp3	the two eldest ate their apples but the youngest could not eat that night she threw the apple away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/995.mp3	she did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/996.mp3	then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/997.mp3	it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/998.mp3	perhaps you can outwit her yet cried another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/999.mp3	the merchant's daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1000.mp3	i promise you i will do you no harm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1001.mp3	you shall not come into my father's house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1002.mp3	pass the charm out to me then said the robber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1003.mp3	when she returned his hand was sticking through the hole in the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1004.mp3	the cries and curses of the robbers filled the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1005.mp3	they tried in vain to break down the great doors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1006.mp3	all my worries about you were foolish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1007.mp3	he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine in the land he could hardly procure even his daily bread and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sighed and said to his wife what will become of us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1008.mp3	how can we feed our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1009.mp3	oh you simpleton said she then we must all four die of hunger you had better plane the coffins for us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1010.mp3	but she left him no peace till he consented saying ah but i shall miss the poor children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1011.mp3	and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1012.mp3	ah father said hansel i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good bye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1013.mp3	but in reality hansel was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1014.mp3	but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought it were better to share the last crust with the children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1015.mp3	early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and gave them each a slice of bread which was still smaller than the former piece
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1016.mp3	we are going into the forest to hew wood and in the evening when we are ready we will come and fetch you again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1017.mp3	hansel thought the roof tasted very nice and so he tore off a great piece while grethel broke a large round pane out of the window and sat down quite contentedly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1018.mp3	come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and so saying she took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1019.mp3	the old woman behaved very kindly to them but in reality she was a wicked old witch who way laid children and built the breadhouse in order to entice them in but as soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked and ate them and made a great festival of the day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1020.mp3	then she took up hansel with her rough hand and shut him up in a little cage with a lattice door and although he screamed loudly it was of no use
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1021.mp3	grethel began to cry but it was all useless for the old witch made her do as she wanted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1022.mp3	grethel she cried in a passion get some water quickly be hansel fat or lean this morning i will kill and cook him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1023.mp3	dear good god help us now she prayed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1024.mp3	creep in said the witch and see if it is hot enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when grethel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake so that she might eat her as well as hansel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1025.mp3	see i could even get in myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1026.mp3	and she got up and put her head into the oven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1027.mp3	and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witch's house where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1028.mp3	then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their father's neck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1029.mp3	grant was only a few miles away but although commander in chief he knew nothing of the hardest fought battle of the civil war until it was over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1030.mp3	my own regiment was in the advance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1031.mp3	our brigade was fearfully outnumbered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1032.mp3	there were no breastworks yet that one little brigade of hamilton's division stood there in the open and repulsed assault after assault

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1234.mp3	i had heard and read of battlefields seen pictures of battlefields of horses and men of cannon and wagons all jumbled together while the ground was strewn with dead and dying and wounded but i must confess that i never realized the pomp and circumstance of the thing called glorious war until i saw this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1235.mp3	i had been feeling mean all the morning as if i had stolen a sheep but when the order to charge was given i got happy

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1238.mp3	but as i said before reader a private soldier is but an automaton and knows nothing of what is going on among the generals and i am only giving the chronicles of little things and events that came under my own observation as i saw them then and remember them now

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1240.mp3	about the time he pulled trigger a stray ball from some direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead and his horse becoming frightened galloped off dragging him through the confederate lines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1241.mp3	on monday morning i too captured me a mule
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1242.mp3	he was wise in his own conceit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1243.mp3	i frequently thought it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule and i would gladly have done so if i could have gotten one half of his no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1244.mp3	mule did not desire to cross while i was trying to persuade him with a big stick a rock in his ear and a twister on his nose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1245.mp3	so he got a large two inch rope tied one end around the mule's neck and the other to the caisson and ordered the driver to whip up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1246.mp3	the rope however was stronger than the mule's no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1247.mp3	on my taking the rope off he shook himself and seemed to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a leetle too smart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1248.mp3	we remained several months but soon we were on the tramp again

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1254.mp3	says he i would not trust a secesh on his word oath or bond march i say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1255.mp3	i soon found out that he had caught sight of the relief on the road and was afraid to shoot i quickly made up my mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1256.mp3	my gun was at my feet and one step would get it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1257.mp3	i made a quick glance over my shoulder and grabbed at my gun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1258.mp3	he divined my motive and fired the ball missed its aim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1259.mp3	i think we must have killed a good many in the old field because we were firing all the time at the solid line as they advanced upon us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1260.mp3	we kept falling back and firing all day and were relieved by another regiment about dark we rejoined our regiment

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1268.mp3	we were not twenty yards off from the yankees and they were pouring the hot shot and shells right into our ranks and every man was yelling at the top of his voice cease firing you are firing on your own men cease firing you are firing on your own men

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1271.mp3	we were at that time at least a hundred yards in advance of the brigade cheatham all the time calling upon the men to come on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1272.mp3	i saw and felt that he was not fighting for glory but that he was fighting for his country because he loved that country and he was willing to give his life for his country and the success of our cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1273.mp3	i thought it had been torn from my shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1274.mp3	as i went back to the field hospital i overtook another man walking along
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1275.mp3	i looked at it pretty close and i said great god
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1276.mp3	he was walking along when all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1277.mp3	but i could not bear the thought of wearing dead men's shoes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1278.mp3	he was stone dead but i dropped that foot quick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1279.mp3	before we arrived at the house we saw a body of yankees approaching and as we started to run back they fired upon us

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1287.mp3	when they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of ireland

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1295.mp3	he nodded curtly and made for the door dodging acquaintances as he went
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1296.mp3	i dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1297.mp3	he's another who's awfully keen about her let me introduce you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1298.mp3	sir harry towne bowed and said that he had met mister alexander and his wife in tokyo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1299.mp3	i say sir harry the little girl's going famously to night isn't she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1300.mp3	the fact is she's feeling rather seedy poor child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1301.mp3	a little attack of nerves possibly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1302.mp3	he bowed as the warning bell rang and mainhall whispered you know lord westmere of course the stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1303.mp3	in a moment peggy was on the stage again and alexander applauded vigorously with the rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1304.mp3	in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harry's judicial frown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1305.mp3	he leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as mainhall himself when at the end of the play she came again and again before the curtain panting a little and flushed her eyes dancing and her eager nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1306.mp3	all the same he lifted his glass here's to you little hilda
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1307.mp3	i'm glad she's held her own since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1308.mp3	it was youth and poverty and proximity and everything was young and kindly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1309.mp3	on the last saturday in april the new york times published an account of the strike complications which were delaying alexander's new jersey bridge and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on west tenth street

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1311.mp3	he rose and crossed the room quickly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1312.mp3	of course i know bartley she said at last that after this you won't owe me the least consideration but we sail on tuesday
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1313.mp3	i saw that interview in the paper yesterday telling where you were and i thought i had to see you that's all good night i'm going now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1314.mp3	let me take off your coat and your boots they're oozing water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1315.mp3	if you'd sent me a note or telephoned me or anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1316.mp3	i told myself that if i were really thinking of you and not of myself a letter would be better than nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1317.mp3	he paused they never did to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1318.mp3	oh bartley did you write to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1319.mp3	alexander slipped his arm about her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1320.mp3	i think i have felt that you were coming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1321.mp3	he bent his face over her hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1322.mp3	and i she whispered i felt that you were feeling that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1323.mp3	but when i came i thought i had been mistaken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1324.mp3	i've been up in canada with my bridge and i arranged not to come to new york until after you had gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1325.mp3	then when your manager added two more weeks i was already committed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1326.mp3	i'm going to do what you asked me to do when you were in london
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1327.mp3	only i'll do it more completely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1328.mp3	then you don't know what you're talking about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1329.mp3	yes i know very well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1330.mp3	alexander flushed angrily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1331.mp3	i don't know what i ought to say but i don't believe you'd be happy truly i don't aren't you trying to frighten me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1332.mp3	the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1333.mp3	emerging at euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon alexander had his luggage sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1334.mp3	she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1335.mp3	the room was empty when he entered

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1337.mp3	she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1338.mp3	she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1339.mp3	i never dreamed it would be you bartley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1340.mp3	when did you come bartley and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1341.mp3	she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1342.mp3	i'll do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1343.mp3	he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1344.mp3	hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1345.mp3	it it hasn't always made you miserable has it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1346.mp3	always but it's worse now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1347.mp3	it's unbearable it tortures me every minute
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1348.mp3	i am not a man who can live two lives he went on feverishly each life spoils the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1349.mp3	i get nothing but misery out of either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1350.mp3	there is this deception between me and everything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1351.mp3	at that word deception spoken with such self contempt the color flashed back into hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1352.mp3	she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1353.mp3	could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly bartley as if i were a friend and not some one who had to be defied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1354.mp3	he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1355.mp3	i have thought about it until i am worn out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1356.mp3	after the very first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1357.mp3	hilda's face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1358.mp3	she pressed his hand gently in gratitude weren't you happy then at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1359.mp3	something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1360.mp3	presently it stole back to his coat sleeve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1361.mp3	yes hilda i know that he said simply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1362.mp3	i understand bartley i was wrong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1363.mp3	she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1364.mp3	you want me to say it she whispered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1365.mp3	bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1366.mp3	it's got to be a clean break hilda
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1367.mp3	oh bartley what am i to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1368.mp3	you ask me to stay away from you because you want me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1369.mp3	i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1370.mp3	hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1371.mp3	you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1372.mp3	and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1373.mp3	she slid to the floor beside him as if she were too tired to sit up any longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1374.mp3	don't cry don't cry he whispered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1375.mp3	it was established at southwark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1376.mp3	the dome of saint paul's was a delight to ursus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1377.mp3	saint paul is a saint only with extenuating circumstances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1378.mp3	he entered heaven only by the artists door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1379.mp3	it might have been ordered for the green box
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1380.mp3	it was a theatre ready made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1381.mp3	against this wall was placed the green box which they were able to draw into the yard owing to the height of the gate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1382.mp3	the placard gwynplaine the laughing man taken from its nail in the green box was hung up close to the sign of the inn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1383.mp3	by the side of the door was constructed off hand by means of an empty barrel a box for the money taker who was sometimes fibi and sometimes vinos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1384.mp3	we are in london said ursus we must be prepared for the gentry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1385.mp3	they began their performances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1386.mp3	with that exception their success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its parallel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1387.mp3	all southwark ran in crowds to admire the laughing man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1388.mp3	the merry andrews and mountebanks of tarrinzeau field were aghast at gwynplaine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1389.mp3	gwynplaine ate up their public
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1390.mp3	besides the small fry the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers real performances took place on the green
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1391.mp3	even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1392.mp3	that success was prodigious still it remained local
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1393.mp3	it took a hundred and thirty years for the name of shakespeare to penetrate from england into france
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1394.mp3	the glory of gwynplaine had not passed london bridge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1395.mp3	these were remarkable talents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1396.mp3	besides this he harangued like cicero as we have just seen sold his drugs attended sickness and even healed the sick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1397.mp3	ursus was satisfied with the applause of southwark but by no means astonished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1398.mp3	at every performance the yard of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1399.mp3	the emptying of tankards did not decrease their success
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1400.mp3	this connoisseur was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the laughing man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1401.mp3	he did not come every evening but when he came he led the public applause grew into acclamation success rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1402.mp3	which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the masterpiece of ursus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1403.mp3	his enthusiasm caused ursus to remark this man and gwynplaine to observe him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1404.mp3	they had a great friend in this unknown visitor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1405.mp3	one evening ursus was in the side scene which was the kitchen door of the green box seeing master nicless standing by him showed him this man in the crowd and asked him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1406.mp3	what a pity that he should not be a lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1407.mp3	he would make a famous scoundrel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1408.mp3	at that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows in dark corners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1409.mp3	what true things are told in stories
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1410.mp3	in gwynplaine evil thoughts never ripened and he had therefore no remorse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1411.mp3	what was this nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1412.mp3	from sixteen eighty to seventeen o four a great change had taken place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1413.mp3	the wheels were all of the same size and high as wagon wheels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1414.mp3	this green colour had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage which was known in all the fair grounds as the green box
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1415.mp3	on the roof from a tube painted green like the rest smoke arose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1416.mp3	the astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1417.mp3	this was the old establishment of ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1418.mp3	unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could of thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1419.mp3	the effect of his appearance had been surprising
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1420.mp3	some believed it to be natural others declared it to be artificial and as conjecture was added to reality everywhere at every cross road on the journey in all the grounds of fairs and fetes the crowd ran after gwynplaine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1421.mp3	the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1422.mp3	this fortune had allowed ursus who was the administrator of gwynplaine's success to have the chariot of his dreams constructed that is to say a caravan large enough to carry a theatre and to sow science and art in the highways
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1423.mp3	for these read fibi and vinos that we may conform to english pronunciation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1424.mp3	phoebe cooked venus scrubbed the temple
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1425.mp3	ursus and homo took charge of each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1426.mp3	this hut in a corner at the back to the right of the door served as bedchamber and dressing room to ursus and gwynplaine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1427.mp3	the caravan was divided into three compartments partitioned from each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1428.mp3	a loft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes and on opening a trap door lamps appeared producing wonders of light
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1429.mp3	ursus was the poet of these magical representations he wrote the pieces
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1430.mp3	then i look perhaps like what i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1431.mp3	this opening looked for all the world like a mouth of hell in the words of the itinerant puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1432.mp3	ursus was in everything in the piece in the company in the kitchen in the orchestra
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1433.mp3	but is laughter a synonym of joy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1434.mp3	such perfect completeness is not in nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1435.mp3	had gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation why not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1436.mp3	according to all appearance industrious manipulators of children had worked upon his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1437.mp3	it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably occult science which was to surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiselled his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1438.mp3	gwynplaine was a mountebank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1439.mp3	he showed himself on the platform
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1440.mp3	it was gwynplaine's laugh which created the laughter of others yet he did not laugh himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1441.mp3	the outside did not depend on the interior
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1442.mp3	no one could escape from this rictus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1443.mp3	all his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange face of joy or to speak more correctly aggravated it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1444.mp3	an everlasting laugh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1445.mp3	the manichaeans believed the absolute occasionally gives way and that god himself sometimes abdicates for a time so also of the will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1446.mp3	the whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1447.mp3	with this exception gwynplaine's laugh was everlasting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1448.mp3	the joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1449.mp3	besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patients to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magic while now it is called anaesthesia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1450.mp3	besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a gymnast and an athlete
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1451.mp3	gwynplaine had yellow hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1452.mp3	his hair having probably been dyed with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1453.mp3	its yellow bristles rather a mane than a head of hair covered and concealed a lofty brow evidently made to contain thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1454.mp3	the operation whatever it had been which had deprived his features of harmony and put all their flesh into disorder had had no effect on the bony structure of his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1455.mp3	the enclosure had formerly been very extensive but was now contracted within small compass and hemmed about partly by high wooden fences and partly by the outbuildings of houses that stood on another street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1456.mp3	the white double rosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement of the season and a pear tree and three damson trees which except a row of currant bushes constituted the only varieties of fruit bore marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1457.mp3	there were also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers in no very flourishing condition but scrupulously weeded as if some person either out of love or curiosity had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they were capable of attaining
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1458.mp3	summer squashes almost in their golden blossom cucumbers now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock and ramble far and wide two or three rows of string beans and as many more that were about to festoon themselves on poles tomatoes occupying a site so sheltered and sunny that the plants were already gigantic and promised an early and abundant harvest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1459.mp3	phoebe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planted these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1460.mp3	bees too strange to say had thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives beside some farm house miles away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1461.mp3	this was a fountain set round with a rim of old mossy stones and paved in its bed with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic work of variously colored pebbles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1462.mp3	it now contained only chanticleer his two wives and a solitary chicken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1463.mp3	it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1464.mp3	these feathered people had existed too long in their distinct variety a fact of which the present representatives judging by their lugubrious deportment seemed to be aware
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1465.mp3	they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched a chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1466.mp3	the distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth in these latter days but so oddly and wickedly analogous to hepzibah's turban that phoebe to the poignant distress of her conscience but inevitably was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1467.mp3	the chicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran with some show of liveliness to her feet while chanticleer and the ladies of his household regarded her with queer sidelong glances and then croaked one to another as if communicating their sage opinions of her character
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1468.mp3	so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the idea not merely that they were the descendants of a time honored race but that they had existed in their individual capacity ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1469.mp3	he held a hoe in his hand and while phoebe was gone in quest of the crumbs had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the roots of the tomatoes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1470.mp3	they have known me much longer but never honor me with any familiarity though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1471.mp3	miss hepzibah i suppose will interweave the fact with her other traditions and set it down that the fowls know you to be a pyncheon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1472.mp3	ah but these hens answered the young man these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn yard fowl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1473.mp3	i prefer to think and so would miss hepzibah that they recognize the family tone for you are a pyncheon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1474.mp3	my name is phoebe pyncheon said the girl with a manner of some reserve for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the daguerreotypist of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1475.mp3	i turn up the earth by way of pastime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1476.mp3	it is like a bandage over one's eyes to come into it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1477.mp3	if you would permit me said the artist looking at phoebe i should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1478.mp3	most of my likenesses do look unamiable but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the originals are so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1479.mp3	there is a wonderful insight in heaven's broad and simple sunshine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1480.mp3	while we give it credit only for depicting the merest surface it actually brings out the secret character with a truth that no painter would ever venture upon even could he detect it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1481.mp3	yet the original wears to common eyes a very different expression
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1482.mp3	he exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1483.mp3	phoebe merely glanced at it and gave it back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1484.mp3	i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1485.mp3	the sun as you see tells quite another story and will not be coaxed out of it after half a dozen patient attempts on my part
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1486.mp3	here we have the man sly subtle hard imperious and withal cold as ice look at that eye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1487.mp3	and yet if you could only see the benign smile of the original
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1488.mp3	well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1489.mp3	if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1490.mp3	is there nothing wild in the eye continued holgrave so earnestly that it embarrassed phoebe as did also the quiet freedom with which he presumed on their so recent acquaintance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1491.mp3	it is nonsense said phoebe a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1492.mp3	since you are a friend of my cousin hepzibah's you should ask her to show you the picture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1493.mp3	so we will be fellow laborers somewhat on the community system
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1494.mp3	she did not altogether like him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1495.mp3	oh rejoined the daguerreotypist because like an old lady's cup of tea it is water bewitched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1496.mp3	she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards a corner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1497.mp3	but put it on the table in the corner of the passage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1498.mp3	what an instrument is the human voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1499.mp3	how wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1500.mp3	fewer words than before but with the same mysterious music in them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1501.mp3	pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1502.mp3	i will sit in the parlor awhile and collect my thoughts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1503.mp3	while thus dismissing her the maiden lady stept forward kissed phoebe and pressed her to her heart which beat against the girl's bosom with a strong high and tumultuous swell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1504.mp3	at some uncertain period in the depths of night and as it were through the thin veil of a dream she was conscious of a footstep mounting the stairs heavily but not with force and decision
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1505.mp3	the narrative it may be is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1506.mp3	in good faith however he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1507.mp3	the author has considered it hardly worth his while therefore relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rod or rather as by sticking a pin through a butterfly thus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1508.mp3	if permitted by the historical connection which though slight was essential to his plan the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1509.mp3	he trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending by laying out a street that infringes upon nobody's private rights and appropriating a lot of land which had no visible owner and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1510.mp3	i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling a life of desire gratification and liberty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1511.mp3	hans our extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1512.mp3	our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1513.mp3	geographers have divided it into four parts and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called sudvestr fjordungr
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1514.mp3	we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1515.mp3	they very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1516.mp3	i could not help smiling to see him look so big on his little horse his long legs now and then touching the ground made him look like a six footed centaur
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1517.mp3	snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1518.mp3	we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1519.mp3	i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1520.mp3	my arms are right but my legs are getting a little stiff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1521.mp3	here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or icelandic house built of wood earth fragments of lava looking like beggars on the highway of life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1522.mp3	a few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1523.mp3	little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of nature's ruins form a kind of terrible chaos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1524.mp3	it consists simply of a few houses not what in england or germany we should call a hamlet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1525.mp3	i took occasion to consult the map to see where gardar was to be found
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1526.mp3	these sacred edifices are however very much like these people who do without watches and never miss them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1527.mp3	to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1528.mp3	in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1529.mp3	but my uncle was in no humor to wait
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1530.mp3	at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professor's legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of rhodes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1531.mp3	he says tide replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1532.mp3	i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fjord for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1533.mp3	accustomed as i had been to the steam ferry boats of the elbe i found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1534.mp3	but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1535.mp3	one dark night at the head of a score of his tribe he fell upon wabigoon's camp his object being the abduction of the princess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1536.mp3	while the attack was successful in a way its main purpose failed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1537.mp3	a counter attack was made upon woonga and he was driven deep into the wilderness with great loss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1538.mp3	three days later minnetaki became newsome's wife at the hudson bay post
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1539.mp3	from that hour dated one of the most sanguinary feuds in the history of the great trading company a feud which as we shall see was destined to live even unto the second generation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1540.mp3	meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of newsome and his lovely indian wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1541.mp3	the other was a girl three years younger and newsome insisted that she be called minnetaki
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1542.mp3	curiously enough the blood of wabi ran almost pure to his indian forefathers while minnetaki as she became older developed less of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the softer loveliness of the white race her wealth of soft jet black hair and her great dark eyes contrasting with the lighter skin of her father's blood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1543.mp3	wabi on the other hand was an indian in appearance from his moccasins to the crown of his head swarthy sinewy as agile as a lynx and with every instinct in him crying for the life of the wild
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1544.mp3	one of newsome's chief pleasures in life had been the educating of his woodland bride and it was the ambition of both that the little minnetaki and her brother be reared in the ways of white children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1545.mp3	consequently both mother and father began their education at the post they were sent to the factor's school and two winters were passed in port arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equipped schools
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1546.mp3	the children proved themselves unusually bright pupils and by the time wabi was sixteen and minnetaki twelve one would not have known from their manner of speech that indian blood ran in their veins
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1547.mp3	it was at about this time in their lives that the woongas became especially daring in their depredations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1548.mp3	at last so daring did he become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head and upon those of a number of his most notorious followers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1549.mp3	but each week added to his loneliness and his longings for minnetaki and his forests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1550.mp3	necessity had become his grim master and the following week he was going to work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1551.mp3	a thousand plans were made a thousand adventures pictured and the mother would smile and laugh and plan with them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1552.mp3	but in time the end of it all came and wabi went back to the princess mother to minnetaki and to his forests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1553.mp3	there were tears in the boys eyes when they parted and the mother cried for the indian boy who was returning to his people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1554.mp3	spring came and passed and then summer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1555.mp3	we shall make more money up here this winter than you could earn in detroit in three years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1556.mp3	we will hunt wolves the country is alive with them and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1557.mp3	three weeks later came wabigoon's reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1558.mp3	on the tenth of october he would meet rod at sprucewood on the black sturgeon river
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1559.mp3	there was little time to lose in making preparations and the fourth day following the receipt of wabi's letter found rod and his mother waiting for the train which was to whirl the boy into his new life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1560.mp3	on the second of the month at two in the morning our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship valkyrie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1561.mp3	but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1562.mp3	well and have we a fair wind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1563.mp3	my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of hamlet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1564.mp3	but no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1565.mp3	the fact is the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of denmark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1566.mp3	no mister hardwigg said the captain no fear of that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1567.mp3	at all events we shall get there some day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1568.mp3	on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mount myrdals yokul which the weather being clear we made out very readily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1569.mp3	the valkyrie kept off the coast steering to the westward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1570.mp3	on all sides were to be seen whole schools of whales and sharks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1571.mp3	nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1572.mp3	the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1573.mp3	then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1574.mp3	he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the island baron trampe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1575.mp3	the professor knew whom he had to deal with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1576.mp3	this modest scholar spoke no languages save icelandic and latin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1577.mp3	when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came to understand one another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1578.mp3	now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands an goes well the worse difficulty is now over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1579.mp3	in the meantime there is not an hour to lose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1580.mp3	very likely i may find there some manuscripts from the hand of saknussemm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1581.mp3	i shall be glad to consult them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1582.mp3	they were now however absent on duty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1583.mp3	though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1584.mp3	i have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1585.mp3	thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows on the roof which grass is carefully cut for hay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1586.mp3	i saw but few inhabitants during my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1587.mp3	the men appeared robust but heavy fair haired like germans but of pensive mien exiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the polar circle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1588.mp3	minnie's flat as the one floor resident apartments were then being called was in a part of west van buren street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks men who had come and were still coming with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of fifty thousand a year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1589.mp3	to carrie the sound of the little bells upon the horse cars as they tinkled in and out of hearing was as pleasing as it was novel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1590.mp3	to him the presence or absence of his wife's sister was a matter of indifference
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1591.mp3	he was of a clean saving disposition and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the west side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1592.mp3	his ambition was some day to build a house on them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1593.mp3	she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every woman intuition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1594.mp3	the walls of the rooms were discordantly papered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1595.mp3	the floors were covered with matting and the hall laid with a thin rag carpet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1596.mp3	then she walked and sang to it until hanson disturbed in his reading came and took it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1597.mp3	one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1598.mp3	now now he said walking there there and there was a certain swedish accent noticeable in his voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1599.mp3	he seemed to be thinking of something else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1600.mp3	minnie began to explain but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1601.mp3	you could get home easy too it isn't very far
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1602.mp3	she asked minnie for ink and paper which were upon the mantel in the dining room and when the latter had gone to bed at ten got out drouet's card and wrote him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1603.mp3	she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train but was too timid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1604.mp3	anything was good enough so long as it paid say five dollars a week to begin with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1605.mp3	a shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1606.mp3	it was under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1607.mp3	narrow board walks extended out passing here a house and there a store at far intervals eventually ending on the open prairie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1608.mp3	it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1609.mp3	these vast buildings what were they
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1610.mp3	when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1611.mp3	he could hardly realise how it had all come about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1612.mp3	no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1613.mp3	he saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1614.mp3	he was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1615.mp3	it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got an envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1616.mp3	then he called harry the boy of all work around the place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1617.mp3	you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to missus hurstwood yes sir said the boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1618.mp3	any answer i guess not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1619.mp3	the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1620.mp3	he was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1621.mp3	she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1622.mp3	if he only had that letter back he wouldn't send it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1623.mp3	for relief he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who were drinking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1624.mp3	all the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being therein enacted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1625.mp3	in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1626.mp3	he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for a week or two meanwhile he would have time to think
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1627.mp3	how about that now his pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to this subject
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1628.mp3	he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1629.mp3	three o'clock came four five six and no letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1630.mp3	the helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1631.mp3	he saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1632.mp3	all day the bar being closed he brooded alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carrie and without the ability to alter his condition one iota
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1633.mp3	it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1634.mp3	it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1635.mp3	he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1636.mp3	he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1637.mp3	he would go to her and tell her all his family complications
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1638.mp3	he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1639.mp3	he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carrie but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1640.mp3	he did not go within a block of the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1641.mp3	he troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1642.mp3	he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1643.mp3	on wednesday he received another polite note from mc gregor james and hay it read
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1644.mp3	dear sir we beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until to morrow thursday at one o'clock before filing suit against you on behalf of missus julia hurstwood for divorce and alimony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1645.mp3	very truly yours et cetera compromise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1646.mp3	so here it was spread out clear before him and now he knew what to expect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1647.mp3	if he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1648.mp3	he was in a fevered state of mind owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1649.mp3	he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble it did not matter what he did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1650.mp3	hurstwood walked the floor mentally arranging the chief points of his situation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1651.mp3	he also thought of his managerial position
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1652.mp3	how would the papers talk about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1653.mp3	many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brow moistened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1654.mp3	he could arrange that satisfactorily for carrie would be glad to wait if necessary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1655.mp3	he would see how things turned out to morrow and then he would talk to her they were going to meet as usual
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1656.mp3	for some reason he felt as if something might come that way and was relieved when all the envelopes had been scanned and nothing suspicious noticed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1657.mp3	while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialised and with him no news was good news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1658.mp3	so little did he consider drouet that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1659.mp3	he grew restless as he ruminated and then decided that perhaps it was nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1660.mp3	she had not been able to get away this morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1661.mp3	he would get one to day it would probably be on his desk when he got back he would look for it at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1662.mp3	after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1663.mp3	he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carrie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1664.mp3	fortunately there was nothing from his wife either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1665.mp3	at one thirty he went to rector's for lunch and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1666.mp3	his first impulse was to write but four words in reply go to the devil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1667.mp3	but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1668.mp3	then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1669.mp3	what would she do about that the confounded wretch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1670.mp3	later however his old discretion asserted itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1671.mp3	something had to be done a climax was near and she would not sit idle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1672.mp3	he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1673.mp3	he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1674.mp3	the long drizzle had begun pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1675.mp3	hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of this thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1676.mp3	he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1677.mp3	he would have some arrangement of this thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1678.mp3	he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other that he had sent the money perhaps he could do it up here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1679.mp3	he would go in and see anyhow he would have no row
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1680.mp3	by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1681.mp3	then he rang the bell no answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1682.mp3	he rang again this time harder still no answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1683.mp3	i imagine there were several kinds of old fashioned christmases but it could hardly be worse than a chop in my chambers or horror of horrors at the club or my cousin lucy's notion of what she calls the festive season
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1684.mp3	festive yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1685.mp3	the reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1686.mp3	it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1687.mp3	the whole thing was a trifle odd
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1688.mp3	there was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1689.mp3	now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name madge i do not know why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1690.mp3	i have never known a madge and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1691.mp3	under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was madge and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1692.mp3	i had no illusions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1693.mp3	i did not expect a princely entertainment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1694.mp3	all night it had been blowing and raining
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1695.mp3	i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1696.mp3	i even bought something for madge i mean missus wilson
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1697.mp3	it was a horrible journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1698.mp3	he was impervious to reason
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1699.mp3	it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1700.mp3	when at last i reached crofton my journey's end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was stationmaster porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1701.mp3	no one had come to meet me the village was about half a mile and hangar dene the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across ploughed fields my informant did not mention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1702.mp3	there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1703.mp3	when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an open spring cart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1704.mp3	in it i was deposited with my luggage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1705.mp3	i did not know what he meant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1706.mp3	i did not ask i was beyond it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1707.mp3	i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1708.mp3	i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1709.mp3	here we be that might be so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1710.mp3	there be the door in front of you you go up three steps if you can find em
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1711.mp3	there's a knocker if none of em haven't twisted it off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1712.mp3	there appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1713.mp3	no answer though i allowed a more than decent interval
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1714.mp3	better ring again suggested the driver hard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1715.mp3	maybe they're up to some of their games and wants rousing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1716.mp3	the bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1717.mp3	presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and a light gleamed through the window over the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1718.mp3	a voice inquired who's there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1719.mp3	the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1720.mp3	there was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice then darkness again and silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1721.mp3	who lives here are the people mad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1722.mp3	i tolled the bell again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1723.mp3	after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1724.mp3	i'm mister christopher from london
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1725.mp3	we've lost the key of the cellar and there's nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1726.mp3	her father is a most remarkable person to say the least
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1727.mp3	but it is quite plain to me that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the snellings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1728.mp3	i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that all mary ann's things had been already bought and perhaps some of them marked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1729.mp3	it is most delightful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1730.mp3	it might just as well be some one else's wedding so unimportant is the part which i am set to play in it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1731.mp3	for instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1732.mp3	the accident in question occurred upon the sunday evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1733.mp3	the girl is fretting but you don't seem to notice it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1734.mp3	i gasped positively gasped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1735.mp3	that's it on your account
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1736.mp3	from a cousin of ours who's in that line
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1737.mp3	i never saw people like the snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of lines
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1738.mp3	i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mary ann's engagement ring but i handed over the amount
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1739.mp3	it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1740.mp3	there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigstye for all i know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1741.mp3	when she heard of my engagement with mary ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstye and that i should pay her rent for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1742.mp3	there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1743.mp3	i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1744.mp3	it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1745.mp3	and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1746.mp3	it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1747.mp3	i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1748.mp3	a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush' and it will be something to have by us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1749.mp3	i know what mamma can afford to give and i will see she gives it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1750.mp3	and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1751.mp3	i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it won't be my fault if i don't get it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1752.mp3	of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1753.mp3	hers has been prodigious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1754.mp3	she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1755.mp3	i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1756.mp3	the fact of having given mary ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1757.mp3	such is the selfishness of human nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1758.mp3	but why on that account they should pity me i altogether fail to understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1759.mp3	we have all been giving mary ann presents and i suppose you mister whiting have been giving her something too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1760.mp3	that was what missus macpherson said to me only the other day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1761.mp3	and what inquired missus macpherson has mary ann given you her love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1762.mp3	someone sniggered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1763.mp3	i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead at least in that circle of society in which the snellings move
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1764.mp3	as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side and they know it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1765.mp3	p s the cards are out for the wedding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1766.mp3	we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1767.mp3	a second cousin of mary ann's is in the cook's tours line
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1768.mp3	he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel it's a wedding present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1769.mp3	besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we don't use
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1770.mp3	in the last communication which he had received from lady milborough she had scolded him in terms that were for her severe because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1771.mp3	and now it had come to pass that his sole remaining ally mister samuel bozzle the ex policeman was becoming weary of his service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1772.mp3	at last he sent word to say that he himself would be in england before the end of march and would see that the majesty of the law should be vindicated in his favour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1773.mp3	in making this he had expected no success though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1774.mp3	missus bozzle was disposed to think that ladies of quality among whom madame t was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the lady's lover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1775.mp3	and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of her husband's exertions she would have taken pleasure in reading every word of the evidence even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1776.mp3	a distinct promise of a hundred pounds was made to him if he would have the child ready to hand over to trevelyan on trevelyan's arrival in england
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1777.mp3	of course it ain't said missus bozzle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1778.mp3	the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was bozzle's law
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1779.mp3	he can't suckle em can he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1780.mp3	when a married woman has followers and the husband don't go the wrong side of the post too or it ain't proved again him that he do they'll never let her have nothing to do with the children
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1781.mp3	i'll tell you what it is b exclaimed missus bozzle it's my belief as he ain't quite right up here and missus bozzle touched her forehead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1782.mp3	drat em all what is it they wants they don't know what they wants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1783.mp3	it's that as makes em i won't say what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1784.mp3	but as for this here child b
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1785.mp3	trevelyan had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it was written and was now with his prime minister before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction received
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1786.mp3	does one mister samuel bozzle live here asked trevelyan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1787.mp3	then bozzle came forward and introduced his wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1788.mp3	but trevelyan was of a different opinion and he was disgusted and revolted most unreasonably by the appearance of his minister's domestic arrangements
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1789.mp3	bozzle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1790.mp3	it is very much easier for such men as mister bozzle to carry decency of appearance about with them than to keep it at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1791.mp3	perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said trevelyan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1792.mp3	missus bozzle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1793.mp3	bozzle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best hat in his hand was aware that he commanded respect and he could carry himself accordingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1794.mp3	i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own child said trevelyan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1795.mp3	if you would have gone to mister skint sir suggested bozzle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1796.mp3	as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gait and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1797.mp3	and all work had ceased with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1798.mp3	he's up in town sir a minding of his parliamentary duties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1799.mp3	i've watched as sharp as watching can go pretty near
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1800.mp3	but if you ask me my opinion why in course they've been together somewhere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1801.mp3	and bozzle as he said this smiled almost aloud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1802.mp3	and he did go away leaving bozzle standing in the middle of stony walk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1803.mp3	sir edward not wholly discouraged by the denial with which dorriforth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kind reception and was so often at the house of missus horton that lord frederick's jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1804.mp3	every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as heretofore he pleaded his cause with such ardour that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1805.mp3	yet did the watchful miss woodley oftentimes hear a sigh escape from her unknown to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1806.mp3	night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad morning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1807.mp3	i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1808.mp3	i thought miss milner you gave me your word that you would pass this evening at home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1809.mp3	yes indeed and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1810.mp3	missus horton rose from her seat moved the decanters and fruit round the table stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1811.mp3	nor had this good woman's officious labours taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1812.mp3	miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1813.mp3	and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1814.mp3	her hand fell motionless from that which she held she appeared motionless herself till missus horton beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1815.mp3	it was not from any real cause of grief that she wept but there was a magnetic quality in tears which always attracted her's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1816.mp3	do you think i would go answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a time suppressed her tears in contradiction to his will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1817.mp3	if you think so madam i see nothing that should prevent me now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1818.mp3	niece i command you not to stir out of this room this evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1819.mp3	miss woodley obediently sat down and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend she never marked by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1820.mp3	at the usual hour mister dorriforth and his ward were summoned to tea he entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and though he took up a pamphlet affecting to read it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1821.mp3	miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the gingle of a tea spoon was like a deep toned bell all was so quiet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1822.mp3	missus horton too in the self approving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1823.mp3	miss woodley did not recollect herself so but was so in reality in her peace and charity were instinctive virtues accident could not increase them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1824.mp3	he coughed drank his tea endeavoured to talk but found it difficult sometimes read and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1825.mp3	dorriforth read on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1826.mp3	after a few minutes pause and some little embarrassment on the part of missus horton at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct she asked miss milner if she would now have any tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1827.mp3	dorriforth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1828.mp3	it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome sometimes unmannerly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1829.mp3	forgive the duties of my office and believe that no one is half so much concerned if it robs you of any degree of happiness as i myself am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1830.mp3	what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly exprest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1831.mp3	she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore after the first attempt she desisted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1832.mp3	on this he rose from his chair and going to her said once more shew your submission by obeying me a second time to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1833.mp3	keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1834.mp3	one who writes of such an era labours under a troublesome disadvantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1835.mp3	in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1836.mp3	not be it ever remembered that the slightest suspicion of immorality attaches either to the heroine of this book or to the leading philosophers of her school for several centuries
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1837.mp3	that divine word who is the light who lighteth every man which cometh into the world had awakened in the heart of mankind a moral craving never before felt in any strength except by a few isolated philosophers or prophets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1838.mp3	the very emperors had arrayed themselves on her side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1839.mp3	julian's last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses at his death the great tide wave of new opinion rolled on unchecked and the rulers of earth were fain to swim with the stream to accept in words at least the church's laws as theirs to acknowledge a king of kings to whom even they owed homage and obedience and to call their own slaves their poorer brethren and often too their spiritual superiors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1840.mp3	but if the emperors had become christian the empire had not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1841.mp3	in the meanwhile the minds of men cut adrift from their ancient moorings wandered wildly over pathless seas of speculative doubt and especially in the more metaphysical and contemplative east attempted to solve for themselves the questions of man's relation to the unseen by those thousand schisms heresies and theosophies it is a disgrace to the word philosophy to call them by it on the records of which the student now gazes bewildered unable alike to count or to explain their fantasies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1842.mp3	they brought before the minds of churchmen a thousand new questions which must be solved unless the church was to relinquish for ever her claims as the great teacher and satisfier of the human soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1843.mp3	but the health of a church depends not merely on the creed which it professes not even on the wisdom and holiness of a few great ecclesiastics but on the faith and virtue of its individual members

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1848.mp3	how iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of theodosius in refusing the usual bounty by which the goths were bribed not to attack the empire the whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of italy and the western empire became from that day forth a dying idiot while the new invaders divided europe among themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1849.mp3	the countless treasures which five centuries of rapine had accumulated round the capitol had become the prey of men clothed in sheepskins and horse hide and the sister of an emperor had found her beauty virtue and pride of race worthily matched by those of the hard handed northern hero who led her away from italy as his captive and his bride to found new kingdoms in south france and spain and to drive the newly arrived vandals across the straits of gibraltar into the then blooming coast land of northern africa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1850.mp3	that extraordinary reform in morals which according to salvian and his contemporaries the vandal conquerors worked in north africa availed them nothing they lost more than they gave

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1852.mp3	that wonderful metaphysic subtlety which in phrases and definitions too often unmeaning to our grosser intellect saw the symbols of the most important spiritual realities and felt that on the distinction between homoousios and homoiousios might hang the solution of the whole problem of humanity was set to battle in alexandria the ancient stronghold of greek philosophy with the effete remains of the very scientific thought to which it owed its extraordinary culture

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1854.mp3	i cannot hope that these pages will be altogether free from anachronisms and errors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1855.mp3	the place seemed fragrant with all the riches of greek thought and song since the days when ptolemy philadelphus walked there with euclid and theocritus callimachus and lycophron

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1874.mp3	we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up that's it isn't it

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1877.mp3	in the meantime after what missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1878.mp3	he had promised to do his best toward persuading catherine to grant sydney an interview
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1879.mp3	even the chance of successfully confiding her to bennydeck's protection had lost something of its fair promise since randal's visit to sydenham

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1881.mp3	considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1882.mp3	what happier future could await her especially if she justified randal's past experience of all that was candid and truthful in her character than to become his friend's wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1883.mp3	shall i say that she may expect an early visit from you when i see her to morrow

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1885.mp3	but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captain's proposals were still waiting for catherine's reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1886.mp3	on the next day but one randal arranged his departure for sydenham so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1889.mp3	randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1890.mp3	with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1891.mp3	missus norman and her little daughter were out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1892.mp3	missus presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1893.mp3	how nice of you to come so soon she began
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1894.mp3	she added looking at him suspiciously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1895.mp3	but you ought to have known that we are only half an hour behind you at sydenham in the matter of news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1896.mp3	the report is premature my good friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1897.mp3	but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether a report is true or false how much gossip would society get in its favorite newspapers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1898.mp3	you are to understand that catherine is a widow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1899.mp3	sit down said missus presty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1900.mp3	you shall hear how my divorced daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandyseal after you left us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1901.mp3	you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1902.mp3	he was introduced to missus norman and to missus norman's little girl and we were all charmed with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1903.mp3	when he and i happened to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1904.mp3	and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that missus norman was a widow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1905.mp3	worse stories have been printed i do assure you worse stories have been printed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1906.mp3	before i consented to answer the child's inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1907.mp3	honestly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1908.mp3	after that i had her mother's authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1909.mp3	she asked directly if her father was dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1910.mp3	that will do missus presty your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1911.mp3	randal passed this over without notice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1912.mp3	a very wise decision she remarked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1913.mp3	have you any message for captain bennydeck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1914.mp3	not at the hotel just now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1915.mp3	it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherine's relations toward bennydeck to return to london without having seen his friend

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1918.mp3	while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sydney the train from london came in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1919.mp3	not having heard from captain bennydeck for some little time randal thought it desirable in sydney's interests to make inquiries at his club
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1920.mp3	the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanation than that the cruise was over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1921.mp3	this alternative in the captain's plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1922.mp3	randal waited a while in london on the chance that bennydeck might pay him a visit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1923.mp3	he is staying at this hotel to try the air of sydenham and he finds that it agrees with him

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1925.mp3	randal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to question catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1926.mp3	after months of separation he received a visit from herbert
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1927.mp3	you distress me herbert more than words can say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1928.mp3	he drank the wine greedily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1929.mp3	whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1930.mp3	he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brother's question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1931.mp3	randal he said you know where sydney is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1932.mp3	i will do neither the one nor the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1933.mp3	you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinking so much of you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1934.mp3	i'm alone do you hear that alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1935.mp3	i haven't courage enough to do it for myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1936.mp3	oh why did i engage that governess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1937.mp3	i'm afraid he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1938.mp3	i tried it yesterday it set my brains on fire i'm feeling that glass i took just now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1939.mp3	he paused and put his hand to his fevered head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1940.mp3	was his mind wandering into some other train of thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1941.mp3	you can't do it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1942.mp3	let me hear what it is first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1943.mp3	i feel for you herbert he said warmly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1944.mp3	she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1945.mp3	let me rest a little he pleaded if i'm not in the way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1946.mp3	he mentioned the name of one of the old servants at mount morven who had attached himself to randal after the breakup of the family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1947.mp3	when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1948.mp3	instantly they absorbed all my attention though i dared not give them a direct look and continued to observe them only in the glass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1949.mp3	yes and a very respectable one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1950.mp3	the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1951.mp3	the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1952.mp3	george nodded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1953.mp3	the boys look wide awake enough if the father does not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1954.mp3	do they still insist that miss challoner was the only person in the room with them at this time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1955.mp3	george
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1956.mp3	have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1957.mp3	i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1958.mp3	the boys look wide awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1959.mp3	a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1960.mp3	i inquired of george with my eyes still on this furtive watcher
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1961.mp3	i took quite a fancy to him why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1962.mp3	i am looking at him now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1963.mp3	just an everyday detective but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1964.mp3	yes he's mercurial in all his movements
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1965.mp3	what does he want
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1966.mp3	i asked as soon as george had returned to my side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1967.mp3	he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1968.mp3	i emphasised complacently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1969.mp3	he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was detective gryce a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1970.mp3	he gave up work some time ago i have been told my husband went on but evidently a great case still has its allurement for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1971.mp3	the trail here must be a very blind one for them to call him in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1972.mp3	i wish we had not left so soon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1973.mp3	he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1974.mp3	however a little later we had a comfortable chat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1975.mp3	it was one which gave me a small triumph over george
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1976.mp3	the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1977.mp3	their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latter's face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1978.mp3	this is very good of you he began glancing down at the aged detective's bundled up legs and gently pushing a chair towards him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1979.mp3	it's the most inexplicable there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1980.mp3	but clews there are absolutely none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1981.mp3	that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1982.mp3	at least that is what we hope
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1983.mp3	it's a case in a thousand gryce
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1984.mp3	the old man's eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1985.mp3	she had no companion near her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1986.mp3	no word no cry just a collapse and sudden fall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1987.mp3	in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1988.mp3	what do you make of it gryce
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1989.mp3	i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1990.mp3	a young fellow who had been hovering in the background at once stepped forward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1991.mp3	he was the plain faced detective who had spoken to george
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1992.mp3	this sweetwater as they called him was i have since understood one of his proteges and more or less of a favourite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1993.mp3	been over the ground studied the affair carefully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1994.mp3	very well then you're in a position to pioneer me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1995.mp3	well well that's honest at all events
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1996.mp3	but i'm in no position to make promises
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1997.mp3	old days don't return for the asking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1998.mp3	whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/1999.mp3	one or two of the musicians from the end of the hall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2000.mp3	naturally they reached her first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2001.mp3	mark sowerby and claus hennerberg
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2002.mp3	honest germans men who have played here for years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2003.mp3	who came next on the scene some people from the lobby
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2004.mp3	anybody before the father came in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2005.mp3	yes miss clarke the middle aged lady with the parrishes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2006.mp3	i suppose she has been carefully questioned very i should say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2007.mp3	and she speaks of no weapon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2008.mp3	not till the doctor came her doctor who was happily in his office in this very building
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2009.mp3	yes mister slater the assistant manager who was in the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2010.mp3	no doubt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2011.mp3	sweetwater someone drew that weapon out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2012.mp3	not altogether by me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2013.mp3	wherever she pleases only i can't walk far
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2014.mp3	it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2015.mp3	but they'll put a man on for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2016.mp3	very good manage it as you will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2017.mp3	i'll wait here till you're ready explain yourself to the lady tell her i'm an old and rheumatic invalid who has been used to asking his own questions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2018.mp3	as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweetwater stole a glance at mister gryce
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2019.mp3	there was no doubting them in this instance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2020.mp3	yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2021.mp3	for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2022.mp3	yes many times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2023.mp3	what made the difference
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2024.mp3	miss clarke started and her sweet face showed a moment's perplexity did i she queried musingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2025.mp3	no a very natural one i should say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2026.mp3	and the glance she cast him while not meeting his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2027.mp3	i know she said what you are going to ask me now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2028.mp3	there was no poniard in the wound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2029.mp3	the time is narrowed down to one and in that one miss clarke was the only person to touch her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2030.mp3	i will trouble you no further
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2031.mp3	sweetwater help me out of this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2032.mp3	but vigour returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clarke and turned to take the elevator
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2033.mp3	the next minute she was in this lady's arms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2034.mp3	no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezzanine what follows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2035.mp3	she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2036.mp3	it did not fall upon the floor around her therefore it flew through one of those openings into the lobby and there it either will be or has been found
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2037.mp3	when she said good night to beenie and went to her chamber over that where the loved parent and friend would fall asleep no more she felt as if she went walking along to her tomb
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2038.mp3	at the time mary had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all as for the first time in minute detail while slowly she went up the stair and through the narrowed ways and heard the same wind that raved alike about the new grave and the old house into which latter for all the bales banked against the walls it found many a chink of entrance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2039.mp3	when she opened the door of it the bright fire which beenie undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2040.mp3	she stood for a moment on the hearth and in sad dreamy mood listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2041.mp3	this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2042.mp3	she was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2043.mp3	it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and through house and garden amid lovely things of all colors and odors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2044.mp3	but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2045.mp3	at the end of it she was in a place of tombs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2046.mp3	she entered and the servants soft footed and silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and restoring order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heeded her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2047.mp3	she was lost lost utterly with an eternal loss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2048.mp3	she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go nowhere she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what question to ask if she met a living soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2049.mp3	but living soul there could be none to meet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2050.mp3	she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2051.mp3	he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2052.mp3	i know it and there is no waking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2053.mp3	the old time was but a thicker dream and this is truer because more shadowy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2054.mp3	her only life was that she was lost
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2055.mp3	shall i pour out my soul into the ear of a mist a fume from my own brain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2056.mp3	thus was she borne away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2057.mp3	with that came a pang of intense pain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2058.mp3	the last strains of the ill treated ill fated intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrel organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its repertory to the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two babies next door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2059.mp3	the young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table for now the late summer dusk was falling and that organ please heaven made full the measure of the day's appointed torture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2060.mp3	then there was silence then a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2061.mp3	and again he listened with a quiet pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2062.mp3	never had any act seemed so impossible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2063.mp3	there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house again she hesitated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2064.mp3	then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2065.mp3	look here he said this is all nonsense you know you are tired out and there's something wrong what is it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2066.mp3	do drink this and then tell me perhaps i can help you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2067.mp3	he hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2068.mp3	he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2069.mp3	is it only that you're poor why that's nothing i'm poor too she laughed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2070.mp3	her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2071.mp3	he told me to stay on at the hotel and i did and then one night when i was at the theatre my maid a horrid french thing we got in paris packed up all my trunks and took all my money and paid the bill and went
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2072.mp3	she said again you are kind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2073.mp3	well then i went into lodgings that wicked woman had left me one street suit and to day they turned me out because my money was all gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2074.mp3	let me think he said oh how glad i am that you happened to come this way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2075.mp3	i shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house and then i shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay the night here there is no one in the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2076.mp3	i will catch the night train and bring my mother up to morrow then we will see what can be done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2077.mp3	you see papa's so very rich and at home they expect me to to get acquainted with dukes and things and she stopped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2078.mp3	it wasn't i who said that said the girl smiling but that's so anyhow and then she sighed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2079.mp3	all the same he added irrelevantly you shall have the latch key
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2080.mp3	you are kind she said for the third time and reached her hand out to him he did not kiss it then only took it in his and felt how small and cold it was then it was taken away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2081.mp3	the lady and the guitar certainly passed the night at hill view villa but when his mother very angry and very frightened came up with him at about noon the house looked just as usual and no one was there but the charwoman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2082.mp3	the silver is all right thank goodness she said but your banjo girl has taken a pair of your sister's silk stockings and those new shoes of hers with the silver buckles and she's left these

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2228.mp3	nothing can part us any more not even death for love like ours will last for ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2229.mp3	not one david that's true love christie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2230.mp3	then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2231.mp3	surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will by and by and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2232.mp3	david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to any thing but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver for that long look into the illuminated face of the woman he loved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2233.mp3	the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first work i did with david was arranging flowers like these for a dead baby's little coffin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2234.mp3	but i think few brides dress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose a sober wedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from a half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft gray woollen stuff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2235.mp3	mister power is waiting are you ready love quite ready
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2236.mp3	you young folks take a wedding trip to the green house while we see how well we can get on without you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2237.mp3	david and christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2238.mp3	a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts and better than any speech or song was letty's broken whisper as she folded her arms round david's empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2239.mp3	all watched with quickened breath and proud souls that living wave blue below and bright with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street and away to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for months had rolled up against the south and ebbed back reddened with the blood of men like these
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2240.mp3	then she saw david and the regiment became one man to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2241.mp3	i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2242.mp3	it had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain in appearance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2243.mp3	here said one of their guides as the procession halted before the little stone building is the palace of tourmaline who is our queen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2244.mp3	what that little cabin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2245.mp3	exclaimed trot of course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2246.mp3	did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences asked the woman evidently surprised
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2247.mp3	these intruders are very peculiar people remarked a man in the crowd
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2248.mp3	they seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2249.mp3	the people must wait outside for there is no room for them in the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2250.mp3	so they followed her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2251.mp3	she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2252.mp3	her complexion was not a decided pink but a soft rosy tint not much deeper than that of trot's skin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2253.mp3	what is it coralie she asked the woman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2254.mp3	the queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2255.mp3	she smiled a little sadly at trot seemed to approve button bright's open frank face and was quite surprised because cap'n bill was so much bigger than her own people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2256.mp3	are you a giant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2257.mp3	perhaps you are trying to ridicule me she continued regarding the sailor's face closely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2258.mp3	there is nothing majestic about me as you know very well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2259.mp3	coralie do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a queen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2260.mp3	even in america ever'body bows low to our president an the blueskins are so fraid o their boolooroo that they tremble whenever they go near him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2261.mp3	but surely that is all wrong said tourmaline gravely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2262.mp3	therefore i am a mere agent to direct the laws which are the will of the people and am only a public servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2263.mp3	in that case said button bright you're entitled to the best there is to pay for your trouble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2264.mp3	if i lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselves and it would be true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2265.mp3	no our way is best
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2266.mp3	the queen has nothing but the power to execute the laws to adjust grievances and to compel order
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2267.mp3	i have one great privilege
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2268.mp3	after my death a pink marble statue of me will be set up in the grand court with the statues of the other kings and queens who have ruled this land and all the pinkies in ages to come will then honor me as having been a just and upright queen that is my reward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2269.mp3	a misfortune of birth placed me here and i cannot escape my fate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2270.mp3	it is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and care free
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2271.mp3	yes it was wet an sticky all right agreed the sailor but the big frog helped us an we got through all right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2272.mp3	you are not like my people the pinkies and there is no place for you in our country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2273.mp3	in all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ever stepped a foot in our land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2274.mp3	we do not hate you as you say the blueskins do nor are we savage or cruel but we do not want you here and i am really puzzled what to do with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2275.mp3	i'll look in the great book first
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2276.mp3	chapter thirty three a confidant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2277.mp3	mister morton replied that far from making any claim upon his good opinion his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find out the means of deserving it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2278.mp3	evil to him that thinks otherwise said mister morton or who holds church government and ceremonies as the exclusive gage of christian faith or moral virtue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2279.mp3	mister morton seemed particularly struck with the account of waverley's visit to donald bean lean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2280.mp3	when i was a young man like you mister waverley any such hair brained expedition i beg your pardon for the expression would have had inexpressible charms for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2281.mp3	he certainly possesses talents beyond the rude sphere in which he moves and being neither destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples he will probably attempt by every means to distinguish himself during the period of these unhappy commotions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2282.mp3	mister morton then made a careful memorandum of the various particulars of waverley's interview with donald bean lean and the other circumstances which he had communicated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2283.mp3	he had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness and the petrifying accuracy with which he attended to every form of civility while he tortured me by his questions his suspicions and his inferences was as tormenting as the racks of the inquisition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2284.mp3	they held conventicles in the open fields and being treated with great violence and cruelty by the scottish government more than once took arms during those reigns
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2285.mp3	since that time their numbers have gradually diminished but a good many are still to be found in the western counties and several with a better temper than in seventeen o seven have now taken arms for government
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2286.mp3	it was about noon when captain waverley entered the straggling village or rather hamlet of tully veolan close to which was situated the mansion of the proprietor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2287.mp3	the houses seemed miserable in the extreme especially to an eye accustomed to the smiling neatness of english cottages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2288.mp3	occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful old grandam with her close cap distaff and spindle rushed like a sibyl in frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from among the sunburnt loiterers saluted him with a sound cuff and transported him back to his dungeon the little white headed varlet screaming all the while from the very top of his lungs a shrilly treble to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2289.mp3	the evil and remedy such as it is still exist but this is remote from our present purpose and is only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under mister dent's dog bill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2290.mp3	yet the physiognomy of the people when more closely examined was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity their features were rough but remarkably intelligent grave but the very reverse of stupid and from among the young women an artist might have chosen more than one model whose features and form resembled those of minerva
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2291.mp3	this avenue was straight and of moderate length running between a double row of very ancient horse chestnuts planted alternately with sycamores which rose to such huge height and nourished so luxuriantly that their boughs completely over arched the broad road beneath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2292.mp3	it was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the boughs of the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2293.mp3	the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each other at right angles formed one side of the inclosure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2294.mp3	it had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the scottish architects had not yet acquired the art of designing a domestic residence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2295.mp3	neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2296.mp3	stables and other offices occupied another side of the square
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2297.mp3	two battlemented walls one of which faced the avenue and the other divided the court from the garden completed the inclosure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2298.mp3	this work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2299.mp3	the court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2300.mp3	everything around appeared solitary and would have been silent but for the continued plashing of the fountain and the whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of waverley had conjured up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2301.mp3	in those very early times there was a man named deucalion and he was the son of prometheus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2302.mp3	after jupiter had bound prometheus on mount caucasus and had sent diseases and cares into the world men became very very wicked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2303.mp3	these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2304.mp3	but men kept on fighting and robbing even while the rain was pouring down and the sea was coming up over the land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2305.mp3	no one but deucalion the son of prometheus was ready for such a storm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2306.mp3	the day is coming said prometheus when jupiter will send a flood to destroy mankind from the earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2307.mp3	but deucalion and pyrrha were very sad for they knew that they were the only persons who were left alive in all the land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2308.mp3	is there anything that you wish he asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2309.mp3	we should like above all things said deucalion to see this land full of people once more for without neighbors and friends the world is a very lonely place indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2310.mp3	go on down the mountain said mercury and as you go cast the bones of your mother over your shoulders behind you and with these words he leaped into the air and was seen no more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2311.mp3	what did he mean asked pyrrha
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2312.mp3	surely i do not know said deucalion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2313.mp3	when at last they reached the plain they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings all eager to serve them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2314.mp3	when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before been known
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2315.mp3	one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might work some mischief to the little baby went and hid herself behind the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and undo any harm the old fairy might wish to work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2316.mp3	the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2317.mp3	it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2318.mp3	now fifteen years after the princess was born she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of a tower and there sat an honest old woman spinning for she had never heard of the king's edict
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2319.mp3	she had no sooner taken up the spindle than being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2320.mp3	he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2321.mp3	one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches lived there but most believed that it was occupied by a great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2322.mp3	the young prince at these words felt himself on fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2323.mp3	scarcely had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side and the other to offer him a path
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2324.mp3	he entered a large forecourt and stood still with amazement and awe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2325.mp3	but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2326.mp3	he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2327.mp3	he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2328.mp3	i have waited long for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2329.mp3	they talked for four hours and had not then said half that was in their heads to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2330.mp3	meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been wakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2331.mp3	the lady in waiting became very impatient and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2332.mp3	then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2333.mp3	the violins and haut boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel of the castle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2334.mp3	he turned to show them the castle but behold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2335.mp3	what a fuss is made about you my dear little friends
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2336.mp3	you surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bare stick such as i see you upon now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2337.mp3	your cousin the wild convolvulus whom i left in the fields this morning does no such thing i assure you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2338.mp3	my young plants require heat or they would not live and the pots we are kept in protect us from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2339.mp3	why not allow your silver tufts to luxuriate in a natural manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2340.mp3	still the rose tree stood out that there must be some great advantages in a gardener's care for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations in the woods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2341.mp3	then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid ugly stick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2342.mp3	he really grieved to see it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2343.mp3	did that lovely creature suppose that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2344.mp3	indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2345.mp3	echoed the flowers tremulously as with a sort of fearful pleasure they awaited his approach
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2346.mp3	making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the convolvulus pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and levelled the sweet peas to the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2347.mp3	meanwhile how fared it with the flowers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2348.mp3	oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fir pole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2349.mp3	the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die of vexation at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2350.mp3	before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2351.mp3	but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2352.mp3	weeds meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2353.mp3	the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favourite garden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2354.mp3	in this position she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2355.mp3	i am not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2356.mp3	with an education which ought to have ensured me an honourable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2357.mp3	i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2358.mp3	i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2359.mp3	besides i was of opinion that a man's profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his wants and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants than those of officers in general
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2360.mp3	our scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2361.mp3	we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2362.mp3	we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2363.mp3	whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought it great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2364.mp3	this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2365.mp3	in every one of the seventy two parishes of the city of venice there is a large public house called magazzino
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2366.mp3	yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2367.mp3	the waiter of the magazzino came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due enjoining silence under penalty of death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2368.mp3	we took our three prisoners to a large boat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2369.mp3	where is my husband
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2370.mp3	never fear you shall see him again to morrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2371.mp3	my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night thanking us all with perfect good faith
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2372.mp3	two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2373.mp3	it went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had an hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour in drinking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2374.mp3	there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2375.mp3	i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2376.mp3	i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2377.mp3	i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2378.mp3	i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught razetta such a forcible lesson i enquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2379.mp3	taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be bled again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2380.mp3	thinking i had a right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2381.mp3	they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2382.mp3	he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2383.mp3	the physician who attended him was named terro he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying a mercurial ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2384.mp3	delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2385.mp3	he entreated me to tell him the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2386.mp3	what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2387.mp3	unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i liked to put
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2388.mp3	i obeyed implicitly and met your excellency
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2389.mp3	the three friends were astounded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2390.mp3	i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2391.mp3	he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2392.mp3	if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2393.mp3	they all asked me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2394.mp3	not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith whatever in that prediction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2395.mp3	they believed that through me they possessed the philosopher's stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2396.mp3	but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the devil and it suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2397.mp3	they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2398.mp3	as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2399.mp3	i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2400.mp3	besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who having nothing else to do are always trying to find out the cause of every moral phenomenon they meet with which their narrow intellect cannot understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2401.mp3	whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2402.mp3	your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gondola at your orders my own table and ten sequins a month
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2403.mp3	you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your adviser in everything that may happen to you in everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2404.mp3	i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2405.mp3	a man said to the universe sir i exist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2406.mp3	sweat covered brion's body trickling into the tight loincloth that was the only garment he wore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2407.mp3	the cut on his chest still dripping blood the ache of his overstrained eyes even the soaring arena around him with the thousands of spectators were trivialities not worth thinking about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2408.mp3	his instant of panic was followed by a small sharp blow high on his chest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2409.mp3	one minute a voice said and the time buzzer sounded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2410.mp3	a minute is not a very large measure of time and his body needed every fraction of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2411.mp3	the buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2412.mp3	only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong measured rate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2413.mp3	he was in reverie sliding along the borders of consciousness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2414.mp3	the contestants in the twenties needed undisturbed rest therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2415.mp3	particularly so on this last night when only two of the little cubicles were occupied the thousands of others standing with dark empty doors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2416.mp3	the other voice snapped with a harsh urgency clearly used to command
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2417.mp3	i'm here because the matter is of utmost importance and brandd is the one i must see now stand aside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2418.mp3	the twenties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2419.mp3	he must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly put that away you're being a fool out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2420.mp3	there was silence then and still wondering brion was once more asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2421.mp3	ten seconds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2422.mp3	he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2423.mp3	a red haired mountain of a man with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2424.mp3	there could be little art in this last and final round of fencing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2425.mp3	just thrust and parry and victory to the stronger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2426.mp3	every man who entered the twenties had his own training tricks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2427.mp3	there appeared to be an immediate association with the death trauma as if the two were inextricably linked into one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2428.mp3	the strength that enables someone in a trance to hold his body stiff and unsupported except at two points the head and heels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2429.mp3	this is physically impossible when conscious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2430.mp3	others had died before during the twenties and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2431.mp3	breathing deeply brion softly spoke the auto hypnotic phrases that triggered the process
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2432.mp3	when the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his second's startled grasp and ran forward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2433.mp3	irolg looked amazed at the sudden fury of the attack then smiled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2434.mp3	he thought it was a last burst of energy he knew how close they both were to exhaustion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2435.mp3	brion saw something close to panic on his opponent's face when the man finally recognized his error
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2436.mp3	a wave of despair rolled out from irolg brion sensed it and knew the fifth point was his
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2437.mp3	then the powerful twist that thrust it aside in and under the guard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2438.mp3	mister quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2439.mp3	nor is mister quilter's manner less interesting than his matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2440.mp3	he tells us that at this festive season of the year with christmas and roast beef looming before us similes drawn from eating and its results occur most readily to the mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2441.mp3	he has grave doubts whether sir frederick leighton's work is really greek after all and can discover in it but little of rocky ithaca
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2442.mp3	linnell's pictures are a sort of up guards and at em paintings and mason's exquisite idylls are as national as a jingo poem mister birket foster's landscapes smile at one much in the same way that mister carker used to flash his teeth and mister john collier gives his sitter a cheerful slap on the back before he says like a shampooer in a turkish bath next man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2443.mp3	it is obviously unnecessary for us to point out how luminous these criticisms are how delicate in expression
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2444.mp3	on the general principles of art mister quilter writes with equal lucidity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2445.mp3	painting he tells us is of a different quality to mathematics and finish in art is adding more fact
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2446.mp3	as for etchings they are of two kinds british and foreign
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2447.mp3	he laments most bitterly the divorce that has been made between decorative art and what we usually call pictures makes the customary appeal to the last judgment and reminds us that in the great days of art michael angelo was the furnishing upholsterer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2448.mp3	near the fire and the ornaments fred brought home from india on the mantel board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2449.mp3	in fact he is quite severe on mister ruskin for not recognising that a picture should denote the frailty of man and remarks with pleasing courtesy and felicitous grace that many phases of feeling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2450.mp3	only unfortunately his own work never does get good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2451.mp3	mister quilter has missed his chance for he has failed even to make himself the tupper of painting

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2454.mp3	he has gone and gone for good answered polychrome who had managed to squeeze into the room beside the dragon and had witnessed the occurrences with much interest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2455.mp3	i have remained a prisoner only because i wished to be one and with this he stepped forward and burst the stout chains as easily as if they had been threads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2456.mp3	the little girl had been asleep but she heard the raps and opened the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2457.mp3	the king has fled in disgrace and your friends are asking for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2458.mp3	i begged ruggedo long ago to send him away but he would not do so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2459.mp3	i also offered to help your brother to escape but he would not go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2460.mp3	he eats and sleeps very steadily replied the new king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2461.mp3	i hope he doesn't work too hard said shaggy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2462.mp3	he doesn't work at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2463.mp3	in fact there is nothing he can do in these dominions as well as our nomes whose numbers are so great that it worries us to keep them all busy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2464.mp3	not exactly returned kaliko
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2465.mp3	where is my brother now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2466.mp3	inquired shaggy in the metal forest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2467.mp3	where is that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2468.mp3	the metal forest is in the great domed cavern the largest in all our dominions replied kaliko
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2469.mp3	kaliko hesitated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2470.mp3	however if we look sharp we may be able to discover one of these secret ways
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2471.mp3	oh no i'm quite sure he didn't
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2472.mp3	that's funny remarked betsy thoughtfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2473.mp3	i don't believe ann knew any magic or she'd have worked it before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2474.mp3	i do not know confessed shaggy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2475.mp3	true agreed kaliko
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2476.mp3	kaliko went to the big gong and pounded on it just as ruggedo used to do but no one answered the summons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2477.mp3	having returned to the royal cavern kaliko first pounded the gong and then sat in the throne wearing ruggedo's discarded ruby crown and holding in his hand the sceptre which ruggedo had so often thrown at his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2478.mp3	go do you hear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2479.mp3	but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2480.mp3	at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2481.mp3	and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2482.mp3	d'avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2483.mp3	d'avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2484.mp3	for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2485.mp3	what do you mean sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2486.mp3	oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken i rave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2487.mp3	do you know the assassin asked morrel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2488.mp3	noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2489.mp3	said morrel sadly yes replied noirtier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2490.mp3	the old man's eyes remained fixed on the door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2491.mp3	asked morrel yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2492.mp3	must i leave alone no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2493.mp3	but can he understand you yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2494.mp3	gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2496.mp3	morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2497.mp3	the old man made a sign in the affirmative
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2498.mp3	it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2499.mp3	but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2500.mp3	the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2501.mp3	noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2502.mp3	the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2503.mp3	the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbe who lives next door to you shall i call on him as i pass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2504.mp3	d'avrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child's room do you wish to see him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2505.mp3	i only wish to be alone you will excuse me will you not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2506.mp3	i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2507.mp3	but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore a burden to their rhymes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2633.mp3	the sharp smell of spirits went through the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2634.mp3	it seemed to me that he despised him for being so simple and docile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2635.mp3	the sick man raged and shook his fist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2636.mp3	he seemed to be cursing people who had wronged him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2637.mp3	quickly it was covered with bright red spots i thought i had never seen any blood so bright
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2638.mp3	he lay patiently fighting for breath like a child with croup
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2639.mp3	antonia's father uncovered one of his long bony legs and rubbed it rhythmically
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2640.mp3	from our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2641.mp3	gradually relief came to all of us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2642.mp3	without a word peter got up and lit his lantern
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2643.mp3	mister shimerda went with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2644.mp3	after the ceremony at the church the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2645.mp3	the first howls were taken up and echoed and with quickening repetitions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2646.mp3	a black drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2647.mp3	something happened to the hindmost sledge the driver lost control he was probably very drunk the horses left the road the sledge was caught in a clump of trees and overturned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2648.mp3	the shrieks that followed made everybody sober
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2649.mp3	the road was clear and white and the groom's three blacks went like the wind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2650.mp3	there are only three sledges left he whispered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2651.mp3	and the wolves pavel asked enough enough for all of us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2652.mp3	they were within a few miles of their village now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2653.mp3	yes how many
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2654.mp3	twenty thirty enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2655.mp3	now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2656.mp3	pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2657.mp3	peter crouching in the front seat saw nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2658.mp3	the first thing either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the clear air louder than they had ever heard it before the bell of the monastery of their own village ringing for early prayers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2659.mp3	they were run out of their village
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2660.mp3	wherever they went the story followed them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2661.mp3	they worked in chicago des moines fort wayne but they were always unfortunate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2662.mp3	during the auction he went about with his head down and never lifted his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2663.mp3	every one said peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2664.mp3	the loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old mister shimerda
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2665.mp3	when he was out hunting he used to go into the empty log house and sit there brooding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2666.mp3	this cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2667.mp3	she was four years older than i to be sure and had seen more of the world but i was a boy and she was a girl and i resented her protecting manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2668.mp3	this change came about from an adventure we had together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2669.mp3	one day when i rode over to the shimerdas i found antonia starting off on foot for russian peter's house to borrow a spade ambrosch needed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2670.mp3	there had been another black frost the night before and the air was clear and heady as wine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2671.mp3	it was on one of these gravel beds that i met my adventure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2672.mp3	i whirled round and there on one of those dry gravel beds was the biggest snake i had ever seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2673.mp3	i know i am just awful jim i was so scared
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2674.mp3	i never know you was so brave jim she went on comfortingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2675.mp3	a faint fetid smell came from him and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2676.mp3	look tony that's his poison i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2677.mp3	i explained to antonia how this meant that he was twenty four years old that he must have been there when white men first came left on from buffalo and indian times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2678.mp3	we decided that antonia should ride dude home and i would walk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2679.mp3	i followed with the spade over my shoulder dragging my snake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2680.mp3	otto fuchs was the first one we met
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2681.mp3	he could stand right up and talk to you he could did he fight hard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2682.mp3	otto winked at me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2683.mp3	a snake of his size in fighting trim would be more than any boy could handle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2684.mp3	throughout this century the power of the church was constantly on the increase and is visible in many important changes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2685.mp3	the ancestors of the present pretender congal surnamed the squint eyed had twice received and cherished the licentious bards when under the ban of tara and his popularity with that still powerful order was one prop of his ambition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2686.mp3	it is pretty clear also that the last rally of druidism against christianity took place behind his banner on the plain of moira
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2687.mp3	the poets of succeeding ages have dwelt much in detail on the occurrences of this memorable day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2688.mp3	like the two kings of sparta they reigned jointly dividing between them the labours and cares of state
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2689.mp3	it was the season when the ancient sun god had been accustomed to receive his annual oblations and we can well believe that those whose hearts still trembled at the name of bel must have connected the eclipse and the plague with the revolution in the national worship and the overthrow of the ancient gods on that plain of prostration where they had so long received the homage of an entire people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2690.mp3	lastly the royal brothers fell themselves victims to the epidemic which so sadly signalizes their reign
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2691.mp3	the only conflicts that occurred on irish soil with a pictish or an anglo saxon force if we except those who formed a contingent of congal's army at moira occurred in the time of the hospitable finnacta
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2692.mp3	as leading to the mention of other interesting events we must set this inroad clearly before the reader
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2693.mp3	the saxons of kent and the southern kingdoms generally were converted by missionaries from france or rome or native preachers of the first or second christian generation those of northumbria recognise as their apostles saint aidan and saint cuthbert two fathers from iona
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2694.mp3	the kingdom of northumbria as the name implies embraced nearly all the country from the humber to the pictish border
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2695.mp3	the barren rock about three miles in length was covered with monastic buildings and its cemetery was already adorned with the tombs of saints and kings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2696.mp3	now every missionary that ever went out from iona had taught that to reduce christians to slavery was wholly inconsistent with a belief in the doctrines of the gospel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2697.mp3	while the liberated exiles rejoiced on the plain of meath the tent of the abbot of iona was pitched on the rath of tara a fact which would seem to indicate that already in little more than a century since the interdict had fallen on it the edifices which made so fine a show in the days of patrick were ruined and uninhabitable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2698.mp3	so slow and patient is the process by which christianity infuses itself into the social life of a converted people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2699.mp3	here the holy prelate of ferns met him and related a vision in which he had been instructed to demand the abolition of the impost
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2700.mp3	the tribute was at this period enormous fifteen thousand head of cattle annually
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2701.mp3	saint moling survived him three years and saint adamnan so intimately connected with his reign ten years
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-clean/2702.mp3	nothing could be more natural than such an assembly in such a place at such a period
