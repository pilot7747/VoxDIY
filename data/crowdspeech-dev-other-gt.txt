https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/0.mp3	yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1.mp3	a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2.mp3	to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/3.mp3	because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/4.mp3	unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about regent's park
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/5.mp3	he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fate's instrument
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/6.mp3	he wrote to marian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/7.mp3	will you let me hear or come and see me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/8.mp3	i scarcely thought of biffen as likely to kill himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/9.mp3	but why the deuce did he go all the way out there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/10.mp3	i hoped you would bring me some news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/11.mp3	poverty i can only suppose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/12.mp3	but i will see whelpdale i hadn't come across biffen for a long time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/13.mp3	was he still so very poor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/14.mp3	asked amy compassionately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/15.mp3	i'm afraid so his book failed utterly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/16.mp3	oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/17.mp3	perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/18.mp3	he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/19.mp3	having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/20.mp3	amy might take a foremost place among brilliant women
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/21.mp3	especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/22.mp3	is it so serious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/23.mp3	even if mister yule recovers his sight it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/24.mp3	our difficulties are so grave that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/25.mp3	he paused and let his hand fail despondently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/26.mp3	i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/27.mp3	there was silence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/28.mp3	the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/29.mp3	recall where i stood when you first knew me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/30.mp3	just now i am in need of a little encouragement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/31.mp3	you don't notice any falling off in my work recently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/32.mp3	do you see my things in the current and so on generally
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/33.mp3	sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/34.mp3	her story in that girls paper has attracted attention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/35.mp3	and i could so easily put her at rest by renouncing all claim upon her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/36.mp3	i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/37.mp3	don't look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/38.mp3	i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable what can i do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/39.mp3	the case is too delicate i fear for my advice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/40.mp3	well i'll go back to my scribbling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/41.mp3	again jasper held the white soft hand for a superfluous moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/42.mp3	yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/43.mp3	marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companion's smooth countenance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/44.mp3	she had divined that there was some grave reason for this summons and the panting with which she had approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/45.mp3	he began abruptly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/46.mp3	he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/47.mp3	there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/48.mp3	i ought to think myself a lucky fellow marian what
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/49.mp3	you are better fitted to fight your way jasper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/50.mp3	more of a brute you mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/51.mp3	you know very well i don't
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/52.mp3	i have made up my mind about our affairs he went on presently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/53.mp3	yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/54.mp3	will you marry me and let us take our chance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/55.mp3	you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/56.mp3	i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/57.mp3	she paused and looked up at him touchingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/58.mp3	dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/59.mp3	has one thing occurred to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/60.mp3	will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milvain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/61.mp3	and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/62.mp3	she listened anxiously and reflected
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/63.mp3	as i have said there is the very serious doubt whether your father would accept money from you when you are my wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/64.mp3	it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/65.mp3	except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/66.mp3	do you think them insurmountable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/67.mp3	that is just what i have decided is impossible marian you shall have the plain truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/68.mp3	i don't trust myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/69.mp3	but shall you face them willingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/70.mp3	put up your umbrella marian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/71.mp3	what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/72.mp3	every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/73.mp3	why need you conceal it if that is the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/74.mp3	is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/75.mp3	we must see each other again marian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/76.mp3	how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/77.mp3	i do wish it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/78.mp3	her emotion had an effect upon him and his voice trembled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/79.mp3	there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/80.mp3	you know so much more of the world than i do can't you advise me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/81.mp3	is there no way of providing for my father
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/82.mp3	good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/83.mp3	i will be faithful to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/84.mp3	he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/85.mp3	moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/86.mp3	in what can there be more selfishness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/87.mp3	but i couldn't say a word that would seem to invite such misery as this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/88.mp3	you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/89.mp3	happiness or misery come to us by fate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/90.mp3	is it in my power to make you happy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/91.mp3	but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/92.mp3	if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/93.mp3	what can you say to me more than you have said now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/94.mp3	remember me as a man who disregarded priceless love such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that's what it comes to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/95.mp3	soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/96.mp3	what can be simpler than the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/97.mp3	it is a thing that happens every day either in man or woman and all that honour demands is the courage to confess the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/98.mp3	marian will you do this will you let our engagement last for another six months but without our meeting during that time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/99.mp3	that seems to me childish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/100.mp3	the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/101.mp3	jasper delayed a moment then asked calmly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/102.mp3	are you going to the museum yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/103.mp3	go home again for this morning marian you can't work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/104.mp3	i must and i have no time to lose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/105.mp3	good bye she gave him her hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/106.mp3	they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the tree opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/107.mp3	jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering a severe humiliation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/108.mp3	his sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his tones and aspect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/109.mp3	a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/110.mp3	yesterday morning he received her final answer a refusal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/111.mp3	you will understand though surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/112.mp3	you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/113.mp3	several days passed before there came a reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/114.mp3	i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/115.mp3	she draws close and satisfies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/116.mp3	he could not forget missus pine avon's eyes though he remembered nothing of her other facial details
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/117.mp3	afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for form's sake but eventually gravitated together again and finished the evening in each other's company
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/118.mp3	but this was not all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/119.mp3	but was he able
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/120.mp3	it was unfair to go further without telling her even though hitherto such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/121.mp3	he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/122.mp3	she lived not far from the long fashionable hamptonshire square and he went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time at least
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/123.mp3	but somehow the very bell pull seemed cold although she had so earnestly asked him to come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/124.mp3	raising her eyes in a slightly inquiring manner from the book she was reading she leant back in the chair as if soaking herself in luxurious sensations which had nothing to do with him and replied to his greeting with a few commonplace words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/125.mp3	just as they turn madeira into port in the space of a single night so this old air has been taken and doctored and twisted about and brought out as a new popular ditty indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/126.mp3	she thawed a little and then they went on to talk about her house which had been newly painted and decorated with greenish blue satin up to the height of a person's head an arrangement that somewhat improved her slightly faded though still pretty face and was helped by the awnings over the windows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/127.mp3	yes i have had my house some years she observed complacently and i like it better every year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/128.mp3	don't you feel lonely in it sometimes o never
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/129.mp3	what an uncivil thing to say she murmured in surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/130.mp3	it is rather uncivil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/131.mp3	as a punishment she did not ring the bell but left him to find his way out as he could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/132.mp3	i saw him at lady channelcliffe's the other night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/133.mp3	jocelyn pierston
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/134.mp3	o didn't he marry her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/135.mp3	said missus pine avon with a start
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/136.mp3	but jocelyn was receding from the pretty widow's house with long strides
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/137.mp3	lady iris had left the drawing room for a moment to see that all was right in the dining room and when he was shown in there stood alone in the lamplight nichola pine avon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/138.mp3	she had been the first arrival
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/139.mp3	as the other guests dropped in the pair retreated into a shady corner and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/140.mp3	he had not been appointed to take her across to the dining room but at the table found her exactly opposite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/141.mp3	the spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/142.mp3	the lady on jocelyn's left wife of a lord justice of appeal was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side so that for the time he was left to himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/143.mp3	it came from the wife of one of his father's former workmen and was concerning her son whom she begged jocelyn to recommend as candidate for some post in town that she wished him to fill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/144.mp3	things arrange themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/145.mp3	but the countess never gave way an inch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/146.mp3	the following was the answer which she returned to the note written to her by aunt julia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/147.mp3	i should not know how to drink wine with them and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/148.mp3	but the girl begged for some delay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/149.mp3	it was a matter that required to be considered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/150.mp3	pride in him might be as weak as pride in them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/151.mp3	if they would put out their hands to him why should he refuse to put out his own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/152.mp3	our tailor received him courteously having learned to like the man understanding that he had behaved with honesty and wisdom in regard to his client and respecting him as one of the workers of the day but he declared that for the lovel family as a family he did not care for them particularly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/153.mp3	they are poles asunder from me he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/154.mp3	but by your good fortune and merit if you will allow me to say so you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/155.mp3	at present i think that the sense of the country is in favour of an aristocracy of birth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/156.mp3	when you were foremost among them did you not wish to be their master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/157.mp3	it is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/158.mp3	when you make much water boil mister thwaite some of it will probably boil over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/159.mp3	i quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders and so the conversation was ended
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/160.mp3	with her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/161.mp3	if you really wish it you shall go he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/162.mp3	and a blue one to be married in alas me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/163.mp3	must i have a pink silk gown to walk about in early in the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/164.mp3	i'd sooner see you darning my worsted stockings sweetheart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/165.mp3	i can do that too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/166.mp3	and now i'll sit down and write a letter to my lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/167.mp3	he hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/168.mp3	but as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation he observed i think we shall have to go back never
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/169.mp3	why not he inquired
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/170.mp3	i cannot understand how you should know me while i have no knowledge of you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/171.mp3	oh but you know me about me at least
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/172.mp3	i should think so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/173.mp3	he's my father indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/174.mp3	but we have been tenants of sylvania castle on the island here this season
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/175.mp3	my father's is a comparatively humble residence hard by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/176.mp3	but he could afford a much bigger one if he chose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/177.mp3	you have heard so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/178.mp3	i don't know he doesn't tell me much of his affairs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/179.mp3	my father she burst out suddenly is always scolding me for my extravagance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/180.mp3	was that this evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/181.mp3	and there on the nets they sat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/182.mp3	jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the montagues to this daughter of the capulets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/183.mp3	no i shall go on and get a lodging in budmouth town if ever i reach it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/184.mp3	it is so late that there will be no house open except a little place near the station where you won't care to stay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/185.mp3	the island was an island still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/186.mp3	they had not realized the force of the elements till now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/187.mp3	he steadied her bodily by encircling her waist with his arm and she made no objection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/188.mp3	he pitied her and while he wondered at it admired her determination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/189.mp3	their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt and they stood within the gaslight of the passage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/190.mp3	he could see now that though she was such a fine figure quite as tall as himself she was but in the bloom of young womanhood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/191.mp3	i will tell the servant to do this and send you up something to eat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/192.mp3	he felt ravenously hungry himself and set about drying his clothes as well as he could and eating at the same time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/193.mp3	by the aid of some temporary wraps and some slippers from the cupboard he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maid servant came downstairs with a damp armful of woman's raiment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/194.mp3	you are sleepy my girl said pierston
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/195.mp3	he again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/196.mp3	the well beloved was moving house had gone over to the wearer of this attire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/197.mp3	and how about little avice caro
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/198.mp3	it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitousness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/199.mp3	still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/200.mp3	if anything could be darker than the sky it was the wall and if any thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/201.mp3	an indescribable succession of dull blows perplexing in their regularity sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/202.mp3	not long after a form moved by the brink of the river
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/203.mp3	this was all that was positively discoverable though it seemed human
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/204.mp3	the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/205.mp3	at this time some words were spoken aloud one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/206.mp3	two three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/207.mp3	four five
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/208.mp3	between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/209.mp3	here the spot stopped and dwindled smaller
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/210.mp3	then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/211.mp3	the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/212.mp3	the window was struck again in the same manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/213.mp3	then a noise was heard apparently produced by the opening of the window
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/214.mp3	said the blurred spot in the snow tremulously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/215.mp3	i asked which was your window forgive me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/216.mp3	well i said that you might
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/217.mp3	o must i it is when shall we be married frank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/218.mp3	i have money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/219.mp3	and we live in two parishes do we what then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/220.mp3	if i said so of course i will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/221.mp3	the fact is i forgot to ask
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/222.mp3	good night frank good night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/223.mp3	we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/224.mp3	several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/225.mp3	the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/226.mp3	inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/227.mp3	the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/228.mp3	under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/229.mp3	after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/230.mp3	the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake that the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father who was a well known whig but that he the son was a democrat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/231.mp3	i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/232.mp3	nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound are very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/233.mp3	if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enough almost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen inches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/234.mp3	it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as to colour it is so much a matter of individual taste
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/235.mp3	but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be kept and reared until they are old enough to be entered to their work
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/236.mp3	he is of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulders of the same pattern and the typical quarters and second thighs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/237.mp3	and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/238.mp3	it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/239.mp3	that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/240.mp3	then they seemed to spring from every part of the country
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/241.mp3	one hears now of the chauston the halstead place very noted indeed the hulton the leigh park the stoke place the edinburgh the surbiton the trinity foot the wooddale missus g w hilliard's missus price's and missus turner's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/242.mp3	eyes brown dark hazel or hazel not deep set nor bulgy and with a mild expression
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/243.mp3	ears long set on low fine in texture and hanging in a graceful fold close to the cheek
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/244.mp3	neck moderately long slightly arched the throat showing some dewlap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/245.mp3	shoulders clean and slightly sloping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/246.mp3	fore legs quite straight well under the dog of good substance and round in the bone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/247.mp3	feet round well knuckled up and strongly padded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/248.mp3	coat smooth variety smooth very dense and not too fine or short
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/249.mp3	height not exceeding sixteen inches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/250.mp3	such a corps such a time you never did see
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/251.mp3	i was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start when indiany made a break
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/252.mp3	this ain't no great stock country says he to the old gentleman with the cane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/253.mp3	no sir says the old gentleman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/254.mp3	there's very little grazing here and the range is pretty much wore out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/255.mp3	the young lady smiled through her veil and the old lady snapped her eyes and looked sideways at the speaker
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/256.mp3	i'm gwine down to orleans to see if i can't git a contract out of uncle sam to feed the boys what's been lickin them infernal mexicans so bad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/257.mp3	i've read some accounts of the battle says the old gentleman that didn't give a very flattering account of the conduct of some of our troops
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/258.mp3	the old preacher listened to him with evident signs of displeasure twistin and groanin till he couldn't stand it no longer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/259.mp3	he shut his mouth right in the middle of what he was sayin and looked at the preacher while his face got as red as fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/260.mp3	swearin says the old preacher is a terrible bad practice and there ain't no use in it nohow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/261.mp3	umphs but indiany kept shady he appeared to be cowed down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/262.mp3	the old gentleman with the cane took a part in the conversation and the hoosier listened without ever opening his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/263.mp3	he was at sodom and gomorrow and seen the place whar lot's wife fell ah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/264.mp3	yes says the preacher he went to the very spot and what's the remarkablest thing of all he seen the pillar of salt what she was turned into
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/265.mp3	yes sir he seen the salt standin thar to this day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/266.mp3	what says the hoosier real genewine good salt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/267.mp3	yes sir a pillar of salt jest as it was when that wicked woman was punished for her disobedience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/268.mp3	right out in the open air he asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/269.mp3	all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are eternal and infinite through the said attribute
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/270.mp3	proof conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/271.mp3	in its nature infinite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/272.mp3	must necessarily exist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/273.mp3	we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our hypothesis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/274.mp3	and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of god supposing the latter at some time not to have existed or not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of god which is contrary to our hypothesis for we supposed that thought being given the idea of god necessarily flowed therefrom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/275.mp3	bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from god's absolute nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/276.mp3	corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in scholastic phraseology god is cause of the being of things essendi rerum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/277.mp3	corollary individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/278.mp3	that too sir you will of course undertake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/279.mp3	then something has happened he has some special information some great news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/280.mp3	when block appeared it was evident that something had gone wrong with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/281.mp3	gone now just when we most want him never
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/282.mp3	idiot triple idiot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/283.mp3	you shall be dismissed discharged from this hour you are a disgrace to the force
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/284.mp3	it is that or your great gluttony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/285.mp3	my gentleman made himself most pleasant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/286.mp3	well at any rate for my sins i accepted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/287.mp3	we entered the first restaurant that of the reunited friends you know it perhaps monsieur
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/288.mp3	i had no fear of him not till the very last when he played me this evil turn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/289.mp3	i suspected nothing when he brought out his pocketbook it was stuffed full monsieur i saw that and my confidence increased called for the reckoning and paid with an italian bank note
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/290.mp3	excuse me one moment pray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/291.mp3	he went out monsieur and piff paff he was no more to be seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/292.mp3	why let him out of your sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/293.mp3	it was only now at the eleventh hour that the italian had become inculpated and the question of his possible anxiety to escape had never been considered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/294.mp3	he left everything behind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/295.mp3	hand it me said the chief and when it came into his hands he began to turn over the leaves hurriedly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/296.mp3	i do not understand not more than a word here and there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/297.mp3	it is no doubt italian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/298.mp3	of course such a consummate ass as you have proved yourself would not think of searching the restaurant or the immediate neighbourhood or of making inquiries as to whether he had been seen or as to which way he had gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/299.mp3	it was a note for a hundred lire a hundred francs and the restaurant bill was no more than seventeen francs hah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/300.mp3	he was much pressed in a great hurry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/301.mp3	directly he crossed the threshold he called the first cab and was driving away but he was stopped the devil
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/302.mp3	he wished to pass on to leave her she would not consent then they both got into the cab and were driven away together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/303.mp3	on the pratzen heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand lay prince andrew bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle piteous and childlike moan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/304.mp3	suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/305.mp3	was his first thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/306.mp3	he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan which aroused his own pity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/307.mp3	lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/308.mp3	prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/309.mp3	during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/310.mp3	he asked on seeing the prisoners
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/311.mp3	i commanded a squadron replied repnin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/312.mp3	prince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/313.mp3	after looking at him napoleon smiled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/314.mp3	youth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a failing voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/315.mp3	a splendid reply said napoleon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/316.mp3	prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his attention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/317.mp3	his face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/318.mp3	the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon princess mary had hung round her brother's neck but seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to return the holy image
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/319.mp3	prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/320.mp3	how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life and what to expect after it beyond the grave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/321.mp3	how happy and calm i should be if i could now say lord have mercy on me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/322.mp3	either to a power indefinable incomprehensible which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in words the great all or nothing said he to himself or to that god who has been sewn into this amulet by mary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/323.mp3	the stretchers moved on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/324.mp3	the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented itself to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/325.mp3	he is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not recover
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/326.mp3	it is at the foot of woman that we lay the laurels that without her smile would never have been gained it is her image that strings the lyre of the poet that animates our voice in the blaze of eloquent faction and guides our brain in the august toils of stately councils

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/328.mp3	it makes the heart ache but to picture such vicissitudes to the imagination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/329.mp3	the knowledge that such changes can occur flits over the mind like the thought of death obscuring all our gay fancies with its bat like wing and tainting the healthy atmosphere of our happiness with its venomous expirations

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/331.mp3	what did what could you do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/332.mp3	i beat about my chamber like a silly bird in a cage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/333.mp3	do not think of moving to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/334.mp3	do not keep the messenger an instant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/335.mp3	he is on my pony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/336.mp3	write only one word to your own henrietta

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/338.mp3	god bless you my henrietta my beloved my matchless henrietta
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/339.mp3	what has that separation not cost me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/340.mp3	pangs that i could not conceive any human misery could occasion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/341.mp3	and yet i ought to be grateful that he was uninjured last night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/342.mp3	i dare not now own how foolish i was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/343.mp3	do not be angry with your henrietta but i am nervous about concealing our engagement from papa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/344.mp3	days must elapse before you can reach bath and i know ferdinand i know your office is more difficult than you will confess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/345.mp3	but come back my own as soon as you can and write to me at the post office as you settled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/346.mp3	the consciousness that you are so near makes me restless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/347.mp3	i wish to meet him with as much calmness as i can command
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/348.mp3	in my recent travels in the west i have felt that out there freedom as an idea has become feeble and ineffectual
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/349.mp3	the same thing is happening now with the people of the west
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/350.mp3	they are flattered into believing that they are free and they have the sovereign power in their hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/351.mp3	thus it has become more and more evident to me that the ideal of freedom has grown tenuous in the atmosphere of the west
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/352.mp3	the mentality is that of a slave owning community with a mutilated multitude of men tied to its commercial and political treadmill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/353.mp3	he who cares to have slaves must chain himself to them he who builds walls to create exclusion for others builds walls across his own freedom he who distrusts freedom in others loses his moral right to it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/354.mp3	have they acquired a true love of freedom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/355.mp3	the great epic of the soul of our people the mahabharata gives us a wonderful vision of an overflowing life full of the freedom of inquiry and experiment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/356.mp3	when the age of the buddha came humanity was stirred in our country to its uttermost depth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/357.mp3	it hardened into an age of inert construction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/358.mp3	the organic unity of a varied and elastic society gave way to a conventional order which proved its artificial character by its inexorable law of exclusion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/359.mp3	life has its inequalities i admit but they are natural and are in harmony with our vital functions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/360.mp3	by squeezing human beings in the grip of an inelastic system and forcibly holding them fixed we have ignored the laws of life and growth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/361.mp3	we have forced living souls into a permanent passivity making them incapable of moulding circumstance to their own intrinsic design and of mastering their own destiny
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/362.mp3	our stupefaction has become so absolute that we do not even realise that this persistent misfortune dogging our steps for ages cannot be a mere accident of history removable only by another accident from outside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/363.mp3	they will be incapable of holding a just freedom in politics and of fighting in freedom's cause
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/364.mp3	it represents the active aspect of inertia which has the appearance of freedom but not its truth and therefore gives rise to slavery both within its boundaries and outside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/365.mp3	junior avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/366.mp3	perhaps after a while i'll get used to it but i'm afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/367.mp3	i suppose that is why marilla disapproves of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/368.mp3	i feel just now that i may grow up to be sensible yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/369.mp3	i just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/370.mp3	eventually however avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/371.mp3	none of the sloanes would have any dealings with the bells because the bells had declared that the sloanes had too much to do in the program and the sloanes had retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/372.mp3	the winter weeks slipped by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/373.mp3	on anne's birthday they were tripping lightly down it keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter for miss stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on a winter's walk in the woods and it behooved them to be observant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/374.mp3	i can scarcely realize that i'm in my teens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/375.mp3	it's a great comfort to think that i'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/376.mp3	ruby gillis thinks of nothing but beaus said anne disdainfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/377.mp3	she's actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take notice for all she pretends to be so mad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/378.mp3	i'm trying to be as much like missus allan as i possibly can for i think she's perfect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/379.mp3	if i had alice bell's crooked nose said anne decidedly i wouldn't but there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/380.mp3	i'm afraid i think too much about my nose ever since i heard that compliment about it long ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/381.mp3	oh diana look there's a rabbit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/382.mp3	they're so white and still as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/383.mp3	i wrote it last monday evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/384.mp3	it's called the jealous rival or in death not divided
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/385.mp3	i read it to marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/386.mp3	it's a sad sweet story
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/387.mp3	cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/388.mp3	you know so much more than you did when you were only twelve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/389.mp3	they grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/390.mp3	i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because i thought she'd likely be an authority on the subject having so many sisters married
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/391.mp3	but she pretended to be geraldine's friend the same as ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/392.mp3	let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/393.mp3	you ought to cultivate your imagination you know miss stacy says so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/394.mp3	only we must take the right way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/395.mp3	this was how the story club came into existence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/396.mp3	no boys were allowed in it although ruby gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting and each member had to produce one story a week
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/397.mp3	each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/398.mp3	mine is rosamond montmorency all the girls do pretty well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/399.mp3	i'm sure that must have a wholesome effect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/400.mp3	the moral is the great thing mister allan says so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/401.mp3	i read one of my stories to him and missus allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/402.mp3	jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic parts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/403.mp3	miss josephine barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/404.mp3	i'm sure missus allan was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/405.mp3	i felt so encouraged when i heard that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/406.mp3	missus lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/407.mp3	now i wouldn't have felt that way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/408.mp3	of course you must be elaine anne said diana
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/409.mp3	of course it would be romantic conceded jane andrews but i know i couldn't keep still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/410.mp3	but it's so ridiculous to have a redheaded elaine mourned anne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/411.mp3	and elaine was the lily maid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/412.mp3	your complexion is just as fair as ruby's said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/413.mp3	it was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mister barry kept for duck shooting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/414.mp3	it was anne's idea that they dramatize elaine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/415.mp3	those days she said were so much more romantic than the present
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/416.mp3	they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing elaine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/417.mp3	the black shawl having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/418.mp3	it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before missus lynde was born
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/419.mp3	jane you arrange this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/420.mp3	it's silly for elaine to be talking when she's dead
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/421.mp3	jane rose to the occasion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/422.mp3	left behind at the landing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/423.mp3	anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/424.mp3	there was one chance just one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/425.mp3	under such circumstances you don't think much about making a flowery prayer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/426.mp3	the flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/427.mp3	ruby jane and diana already awaiting it on the lower headland saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that anne had gone down with it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/428.mp3	the minutes passed by each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/429.mp3	why didn't somebody come where had the girls gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/430.mp3	her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/431.mp3	anne shirley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/432.mp3	how on earth did you get there he exclaimed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/433.mp3	it was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/434.mp3	what has happened anne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/435.mp3	asked gilbert taking up his oars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/436.mp3	we were playing elaine explained anne frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge i mean the flat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/437.mp3	for a moment anne hesitated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/438.mp3	her heart gave a quick queer little beat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/439.mp3	her resentment which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/440.mp3	no she said coldly i shall never be friends with you gilbert blythe and i don't want to be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/441.mp3	all right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/442.mp3	i'll never ask you to be friends again anne shirley and i don't care either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/443.mp3	of course he had insulted her terribly but still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/444.mp3	everything i do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/445.mp3	anne's presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/446.mp3	will you ever have any sense anne groaned marilla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/447.mp3	i don't see how said marilla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/448.mp3	ever since i came to green gables i've been making mistakes and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/449.mp3	vanity and vexation of spirit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/450.mp3	the spring was abroad in the land and marilla's sober middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/451.mp3	i must say with all her faults i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and i'm real sorry to find her so now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/452.mp3	perhaps you're judging her too hasty marilla
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/453.mp3	of course i knew you'd take her part matthew but i'm bringing her up not you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/454.mp3	demanded marilla anxiously going over to the bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/455.mp3	anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/456.mp3	get right up this minute and tell me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/457.mp3	this minute i say there now what is it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/458.mp3	anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/459.mp3	yes it's green moaned anne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/460.mp3	i thought nothing could be as bad as red hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/461.mp3	you haven't got into any scrape for over two months and i was sure another one was due
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/462.mp3	now then what did you do to your hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/463.mp3	anne shirley didn't you know it was a wicked thing to do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/464.mp3	yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/465.mp3	i know what it feels like to have your word doubted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/466.mp3	and missus allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they're not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/467.mp3	but i hadn't then and i believed every word he said implicitly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/468.mp3	who said who are you talking about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/469.mp3	oh i didn't let him in the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/470.mp3	in a trice i saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/471.mp3	oh marilla what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/472.mp3	your hair must be cut off there is no other way you can't go out with it looking like that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/473.mp3	with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/474.mp3	but there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color is there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/475.mp3	i'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off if it won't interfere
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/476.mp3	it seems such a tragic thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/477.mp3	anne wept then but later on when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/478.mp3	yes i will too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/479.mp3	i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/480.mp3	i expect something will happen to my nose next
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/481.mp3	anne's clipped head made a sensation in school on the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/482.mp3	it's hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and i wanted to say something back but i didn't
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/483.mp3	it makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesn't it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/484.mp3	i mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and i shall never try to be beautiful again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/485.mp3	of course it's better to be good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/486.mp3	i do really want to be good marilla like you and missus allan and miss stacy and grow up to be a credit to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/487.mp3	diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/488.mp3	i will call it a snood that sounds so romantic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/489.mp3	my head is better now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/490.mp3	it was terrible bad this afternoon though
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/491.mp3	i have been told that mister van brandt is in prison for debt i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/492.mp3	and i saw for myself last night that he had left you helpless
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/493.mp3	he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/494.mp3	his cruel creditors are more to blame than he is for the poverty that has fallen on us
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/495.mp3	even this negative defense of van brandt stung me to the quick i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/496.mp3	i ought to have remembered that a woman can forgive almost any wrong that a man can inflict on her when he is the man whom she loves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/497.mp3	she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/498.mp3	how can you speak so cruelly to me she asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/499.mp3	you know to my shame i confessed it to you the last time we met you know that my heart in secret is all yours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/500.mp3	what wrong are you talking of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/501.mp3	is it the wrong i suffered when van brandt married me with a wife living at the time and living still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/502.mp3	do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my life the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/503.mp3	it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/504.mp3	and you talk of my being your wife knowing that the child accepts me as her second father i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/505.mp3	it would be better and happier for us both if you had as little pride as the child pride she repeated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/506.mp3	in such a position as mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/507.mp3	a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/508.mp3	am i to marry you for my food and shelter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/509.mp3	am i to marry you because there is no lawful tie that binds me to the father of my child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/510.mp3	bad as he is he has not forsaken me he has been forced away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/511.mp3	my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/512.mp3	the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard of your friends
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/513.mp3	the wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/514.mp3	oh what are men made of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/515.mp3	how can you how can you speak of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/516.mp3	i yielded and spoke of it no more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/517.mp3	every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/518.mp3	bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake hopeless infatuation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/519.mp3	i don't deny it i don't excuse it hopeless infatuation you have forgiven me i said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/520.mp3	let me deserve to be forgiven
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/521.mp3	it is something to be your only friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/522.mp3	you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/523.mp3	complete the good work that you have begun she answered gratefully help me back to health
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/524.mp3	make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chances of living for some years yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/525.mp3	a doctor's estimate of your chances of living i repeated what do you mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/526.mp3	i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mister van brandt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/527.mp3	does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts i asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/528.mp3	why need you hesitate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/529.mp3	you know that there is nothing i will not do to relieve your anxieties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/530.mp3	never let me tell you the plain truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/531.mp3	there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/532.mp3	yes this is his position in two words a little while since he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/533.mp3	unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/534.mp3	the snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/535.mp3	in the eye of the law she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intents and purposes her own mistress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/536.mp3	what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give van brandt a direct interest in her death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/537.mp3	thanks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/538.mp3	i could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour's notice and he was the man to accept my proposal quite as easily as i could make it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/539.mp3	you are quite mistaken i replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/540.mp3	i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mister van brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/541.mp3	are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/542.mp3	i know nothing about it she said sadly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/543.mp3	will you let me ask the advice of my lawyers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/544.mp3	they are trustworthy and experienced men and i am sure they can be of use to you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/545.mp3	cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/546.mp3	promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mister van brandt she rejoined and i will accept your help gratefully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/547.mp3	i could honestly promise that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/548.mp3	my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that i had now determined to pursue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/549.mp3	i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/550.mp3	kiss me she whispered before you go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/551.mp3	it is only your goodness that overpowers me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/552.mp3	what is necessary to the completeness of the story at this stage is not to recapitulate but to take up some of the loose ends of threads woven in and follow them through until the clear and comprehensive picture of events can be seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/553.mp3	the way of the inventor is hard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/554.mp3	he can sometimes raise capital to help him in working out his crude conceptions but even then it is frequently done at a distressful cost of personal surrender
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/555.mp3	when the result is achieved the invention makes its appeal on the score of economy of material or of effort and then labor often awaits with crushing and tyrannical spirit to smash the apparatus or forbid its very use
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/556.mp3	possibly our national optimism as revealed in invention the seeking a higher good needs some check
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/557.mp3	possibly the leaders would travel too fast and too far on the road to perfection if conservatism did not also play its salutary part in insisting that the procession move forward as a whole
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/558.mp3	on the contrary the conditions for its acceptance had been ripening fast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/559.mp3	yet the very vogue of the electric arc light made harder the arrival of the incandescent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/560.mp3	a number of parent arc lighting companies were in existence and a great many local companies had been called into being under franchises for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for street lighting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/561.mp3	thus in a curious manner the modern art of electric lighting was in a very true sense divided against itself with intense rivalries and jealousies which were none the less real because they were but temporary and occurred in a field where ultimate union of forces was inevitable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/562.mp3	hence twenty years after the first edison stations were established the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no less than sixty seven per cent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/563.mp3	it will be readily understood that under these conditions the modern lighting company supplies to its customers both incandescent and arc lighting frequently from the same dynamo electric machinery as a source of current and that the old feud as between the rival systems has died out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/564.mp3	in fact for some years past the presidents of the national electric light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great edison lighting companies in the leading cities
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/565.mp3	the other strong opposition to the incandescent light came from the gas industry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/566.mp3	there also the most bitter feeling was shown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/567.mp3	the gas manager did not like the arc light but it interfered only with his street service which was not his largest source of income by any means
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/568.mp3	here again was given a most convincing demonstration of the truth that such an addition to the resources of mankind always carries with it unsuspected benefits even for its enemies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/569.mp3	this was not long nor universally the spirit shown and to day in hundreds of cities the electric and gas properties are united under the one management which does not find it impossible to push in a friendly and progressive way the use of both illuminants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/570.mp3	the most conspicuous example of this identity of interest is given in new york itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/571.mp3	so much for the early opposition of which there was plenty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/572.mp3	but it may be questioned whether inertia is not equally to be dreaded with active ill will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/573.mp3	of course a great many accounts were written and read but while genuine interest was aroused it was necessarily apathetic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/574.mp3	we got it at a great bargain and only paid a small sum down and the balance on mortgage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/575.mp3	we sold them for forty cents but there were only about twenty or thirty thousand of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/576.mp3	the fourth year i got it down to thirty seven cents and i made all the money up in one year that i had lost previously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/577.mp3	one of the incidents which caused a very great cheapening was that when we started one of the important processes had to be done by experts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/578.mp3	after feeling around for some days i got a clew how to do it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/579.mp3	i then made another machine which did the work nicely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/580.mp3	incidentally it may be noted as illustrative of the problems brought to edison that while he had the factory at harrison an importer in the chinese trade went to him and wanted a dynamo to be run by hand power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/581.mp3	for making the dynamos edison secured as noted in the preceding chapter the roach iron works on goerck street new york and this was also equipped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/582.mp3	to sigmund bergmann who had worked previously with edison on telephone apparatus and phonographs and was already making edison specialties in a small way in a loft on wooster street new york was assigned the task of constructing sockets fixtures meters safety fuses and numerous other details
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/583.mp3	in the early part of eighteen eighty one the edison electric light company leased the old bishop mansion at sixty five fifth avenue close to fourteenth street for its headquarters and show rooms
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/584.mp3	this was one of the finest homes in the city of that period and its acquisition was a premonitory sign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/585.mp3	the experience with the little gas engine was rather startling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/586.mp3	one day it was not going very well and i went down to the man in charge and got exploring around
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/587.mp3	for the next four or five years sixty five was a veritable beehive day and night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/588.mp3	the routine was very much the same as that at the laboratory in its utter neglect of the clock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/589.mp3	i was telling a gentleman one day that i could not keep a cigar even if i locked them up in my desk they would break it open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/590.mp3	he suggested to me that he had a friend over on eighth avenue who made a superior grade of cigars and who would show them a trick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/591.mp3	he said he would have some of them made up with hair and old paper and i could put them in without a word and see the result
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/592.mp3	i thought no more about the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/593.mp3	i didn't remember anything about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/594.mp3	i was too busy on other things to notice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/595.mp3	speaking of those days or nights edison says years ago one of the great violinists was remenyi
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/596.mp3	he would talk with me but i never asked him to bring his violin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/597.mp3	one night he came with his violin about twelve o'clock
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/598.mp3	after that every time he came to new york he used to call at sixty five late at night with his violin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/599.mp3	another visitor who used to give us a good deal of amusement and pleasure was captain shaw the head of the london fire brigade
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/600.mp3	he would go out among the fire laddies and have a great time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/601.mp3	speaking of telling stories i once got telling a man stories at the harrison lamp factory in the yard as he was leaving
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/602.mp3	it was winter and he was all in furs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/603.mp3	i had nothing on to protect me against the cold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/604.mp3	then i got pleurisy and had to be shipped to florida for cure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/605.mp3	it had merely enjoyed the delights of anxious anticipation and the perilous pleasure of backing edison's experiments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/606.mp3	now active exploitation was required
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/607.mp3	london its guilt and glory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/608.mp3	they say best men are molded out of faults and for the most become much more the better for being a little bad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/609.mp3	standing on a broken column of the old steeple three hundred feet above primrose hill william struck an attitude of theatrical fashion and uttered the following oratorical flight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/610.mp3	glorious london
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/611.mp3	sad how sad to think that the day will come when not a vestige of this wonderful mass of human energy shall remain where the cry of the wolf bat and bittern shall only be heard and nature again resume her rustic splendid desolation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/612.mp3	the devil's tavern was a resort for actors authors bohemians lords and ladies who did not retire early to their downy couches
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/613.mp3	william and myself soon found rest in deep slumber and wafted away into a dreamless realm our tired bodies lay in the enfolding arms of morpheus until the porter knocked at our door the next morning as the clock of the tower struck the hour of nine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/614.mp3	our first sight of sunrise in london gave us great expectations of fame and fortune for surely all we had was glowing expectations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/615.mp3	oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/616.mp3	deuces won double and sixes treble coin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/617.mp3	william to the great amazement of the dealer flung a guinea in the center pot which was immediately tapped by jack while the others looked on in silent expectation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/618.mp3	the polite jack replied all right sir take your word for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/619.mp3	i have set my life upon a cast and will stand the hazard of the die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/620.mp3	i immediately followed in his footsteps and found him joking with the landlady about a couple of infant bull pups she was fondling in her capacious lap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/621.mp3	if he had dropped out of the clouds william could not have been more pleased or surprised and the feeling was reciprocal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/622.mp3	the printing shop of field was only a short distance from the devil's tavern and we were invited to visit the establishment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/623.mp3	james burbage gazed for a moment on the manly form of william and blurted out in his bluff manner what do you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/624.mp3	but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/625.mp3	i must find some way to give the little ones a nice christmas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/626.mp3	tommo will like to have me go with him and sing while he plays his harp in the streets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/627.mp3	yes i will try and then if i do well the little ones shall have a merry christmas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/628.mp3	but see then it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes one's fingers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/629.mp3	she thanked tommo and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not refuse her anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/630.mp3	then she washed out little ranza's frock and put it to dry because she would not be able to do it the next day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/631.mp3	she longed to make the beds and dress the children over night she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/632.mp3	when she had told her plan peter benari shook his head and thought it would never do but tessa begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in new york
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/633.mp3	as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tommo's mother who would see about the fire and the dinner for the good woman loved tessa and entered into her little plans with all her heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/634.mp3	poor tessa's heart beat fast as she trudged away with tommo who slung his harp over his shoulder and gave her his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/635.mp3	it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/636.mp3	see now have no fear give them bella monica that is merry and will make the laugh whispered tommo tuning his harp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/637.mp3	one fat old frenchman nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/638.mp3	but tommo shook his curly head and answered soberly yes i took you there first for they love music and are of our country but up among the great houses we shall not always do well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/639.mp3	but she had made half a dollar for tommo divided the money fairly and she felt rich with her share
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/640.mp3	her hands were covered with chilblains for she had no mittens but she put them under her shawl and scuffled merrily away in her big boots feeling so glad that the week was over and nearly three dollars safe in her pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/641.mp3	how gay the streets were that day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/642.mp3	how brisk every one was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/643.mp3	but i can't so i'll fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/644.mp3	who knows what may happen if we do well returned tommo nodding wisely for he had a plan as well as tessa and kept chuckling over it as he trudged through the mud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/645.mp3	we'll try one more street and then go home thou art so tired little one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/646.mp3	at the fourth some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/647.mp3	tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/648.mp3	i'll ask mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/649.mp3	as the door opened tessa saw what looked to her like a fairy feast all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine in tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/650.mp3	ah yes i shall come with much gladness and play as never in my life before cried tommo with a flourish of the old cap that made the children laugh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/651.mp3	give these to your brothers said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges into tessa's hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/652.mp3	ah so kind so very kind i have no way to say thank you but ranza shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your tree cried tessa folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/653.mp3	she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/654.mp3	four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for her a warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/655.mp3	tessa screamed and danced in her delight and up tumbled all the children to scream and dance with her making a regular carnival on a small scale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/656.mp3	in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tommo had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/657.mp3	little ranza was accepted with delight by the kind lady and her children and tessa learned the song quite easily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/658.mp3	arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/659.mp3	before they went home the kind mamma told tessa she should be her friend and gave her a motherly kiss which warmed the child's heart and seemed to set a seal upon that promise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/660.mp3	never mind polly said jasper there's all next summer and after our winter in dresden and all our hard work over music won't it be fine though to jaunt round again and his eyes glistened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/661.mp3	and you'll go on drawing and painting until you get to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then we'll see something you've done in the louvre maybe the louvre cried adela o dear me polly pepper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/662.mp3	tom selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/663.mp3	what's up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner it's just this tom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/664.mp3	when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into at all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/665.mp3	oh isn't it oats peas beans and barley grow cried polly as they watched them intently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/666.mp3	and his long arm went out and picked a jacket end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/667.mp3	and presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away and the game was over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/668.mp3	i'm glad the girls over here have fun said polly as grandpapa and his party moved off isn't it nice to think they do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/669.mp3	two or three days of rest at martigny put everybody in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that were behindhand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/670.mp3	that's my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i am going to begin on joel's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/671.mp3	one two said polly counting why i thought i'd written three well this one is most finished jasper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/672.mp3	dare said tom delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/673.mp3	i'll post yours too polly give them here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/674.mp3	then his face brightened and he said and she's right polly while polly fished a franc out of joel's little money bag that hung at her belt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/675.mp3	do get the stamps please jasper and put them on as he took up her two letters and she gave the bag a little pat for joel's sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/676.mp3	i don't know where we are going to get nice white paper for our round robin said polly leaning her elbows on the table and her chin in her hands i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/677.mp3	i want polly to said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly held out alluringly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/678.mp3	phronsie who hadn't heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible fell to scribbling the letters as fast as she could all of them running down hill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/679.mp3	it's all right granddaddy'll like it he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/680.mp3	i tell you you don't know my granddaddy he's got lots of fun in him he added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/681.mp3	i won't cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down her nose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/682.mp3	then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/683.mp3	we must put in little pictures said polly trying to make herself cheery as the work went busily on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/684.mp3	polly you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/685.mp3	i wouldn't feel so badly polly he managed to whisper when phronsie was absorbed with her work he'll like it probably just as father did the gingerbread boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/686.mp3	he seems to accomplish something every time he goes observed jasper drily halloo just look at him now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/687.mp3	o dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now you've joggled the table again then she caught polly's eye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/688.mp3	rather not much obliged tom bobbed his thanks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/689.mp3	picture after picture cut from railroad guide books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/690.mp3	the rest of it is nice whispered jasper and i venture to say he'll like that the best of all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/691.mp3	mister king thought so too and he beamed at phronsie so you did he cried now that's fine i wish you'd write me a letter sometime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/692.mp3	the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him and the superintendent of the sunday school on the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/693.mp3	so awed were they by the presence of a living united states senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/694.mp3	after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pulling hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/695.mp3	the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and bored the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar then the town dignitaries had their say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/696.mp3	am i in some populous centre of my own country where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/697.mp3	then where am i yes where am i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/698.mp3	my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/699.mp3	earth has no higher no grander position for me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/700.mp3	then what is it what did my consciousness reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/701.mp3	ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/702.mp3	they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/703.mp3	i hope you love your sunday school ah i see by your faces that you do that is right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/704.mp3	always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/705.mp3	and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/706.mp3	why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/707.mp3	it was senator of the united states
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/708.mp3	that poor little boy that loved his sunday school became that man that man stands before you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/709.mp3	above all things my children be honest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/710.mp3	when senator dilworthy departed from cattleville he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the united states senate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/711.mp3	and again when the artist following malicorne's advice was a little late in arriving and when saint aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/712.mp3	in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty and with desire in the assurance of possession
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/713.mp3	in this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidante she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined skeptics
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/714.mp3	but the door remained closed and neither saint aignan nor the painter appeared nor did the hangings even move
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/715.mp3	go then dearest love said the king but return quickly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/716.mp3	no no not to day sire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/717.mp3	i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/718.mp3	la valliere with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but could not articulate one word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/719.mp3	at the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rang through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/720.mp3	the captain sitting buried in his leathern armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twisted his mustache
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/721.mp3	d'artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend's son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/722.mp3	raoul my boy he said by what lucky accident does it happen that the king has recalled you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/723.mp3	these words did not sound agreeably in the young man's ears who as he seated himself replied upon my word i cannot tell you all that i know is i have come back hum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/724.mp3	that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/725.mp3	i do not understand that at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/726.mp3	raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/727.mp3	what the deuce is the matter that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/728.mp3	said the captain do people nowadays assume that sort of airs in england
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/729.mp3	i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/730.mp3	will you not say something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/731.mp3	i have too much to say

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/734.mp3	d'artagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/735.mp3	you are unhappy about something he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/736.mp3	i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur d'artagnan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/737.mp3	nay do not pretend to be astonished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/738.mp3	i am not pretending to be astonished my friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/739.mp3	i have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me in two words i am the most wretched of living beings oh oh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/740.mp3	she is deceiving you said d'artagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words who makes use of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/741.mp3	every one ah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/742.mp3	if every one says so there must be some truth in it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/743.mp3	not for a friend for a son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/744.mp3	the deuce take it you are really ill from curiosity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/745.mp3	no it is not from curiosity it is from love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/746.mp3	good another big word

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/748.mp3	well suppose it were only that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/749.mp3	no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/750.mp3	i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/751.mp3	you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/752.mp3	oh try try
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/753.mp3	i go far even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicate it to you you are my friend you say indeed yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/754.mp3	very good i should quarrel with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/755.mp3	i never complain as you know but as heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brains i will go and get the first person i meet to give me the information which you withhold i will tell him he lies and and you would kill him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/756.mp3	and a fine affair that would be so much the better what should i care
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/757.mp3	you now assume a different tone instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean very fine indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/758.mp3	how much i should regret you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/759.mp3	of course i should go about all day saying ah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/760.mp3	what a fine stupid fellow that bragelonne was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/761.mp3	as great a stupid as i ever met with
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/762.mp3	go then raoul go and get yourself disposed of if you like
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/763.mp3	i hardly know who can have taught you logic but deuce take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/764.mp3	raoul buried his face in his hands murmuring no no i have not a single friend in the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/765.mp3	idle fancies monsieur i do not laugh at you although i am a gascon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/766.mp3	a carpenter what do you mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/767.mp3	upon my word i don't know some one told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain flooring
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/768.mp3	oh i don't know where
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/769.mp3	in whose room then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/770.mp3	i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/771.mp3	but the painter then the portrait
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/772.mp3	why you seem to have only that name in your mouth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/773.mp3	i do not suppose it will concern you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/774.mp3	yes you are right and he made a step or two as if he were going to leave where are you going
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/775.mp3	to look for some one who will tell me the truth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/776.mp3	who is that a woman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/777.mp3	you wish to be consoled by some one and you will be so at once she will tell you nothing ill of herself of course so be off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/778.mp3	you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul the woman i mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/779.mp3	well i admit it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/780.mp3	and in point of fact why should i play with you as a cat does with a poor mouse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/781.mp3	you distress me you do indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/782.mp3	wait if you can
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/783.mp3	i cannot so much the worse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/784.mp3	ah said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/785.mp3	how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/786.mp3	she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him who then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/787.mp3	the dates seem unimportant but throughout the period the officers and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/788.mp3	bowers attacked the ship's stores surveyed relisted and restowed them saving very much space by unstowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/789.mp3	without steam the leak can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/790.mp3	as the ship was and in her present heavily laden condition it would certainly have taken three to four hours each day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/791.mp3	the large green tent was put up and proper supports made for it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/792.mp3	the engine room staff and anderson's people on the engines scientists were stowing their laboratories the cook refitting his galley and so forth not a single spot but had its band of workers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/793.mp3	the men's space such as it is therefore extends from the fore hatch to the stem on the main deck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/794.mp3	under the forecastle are stalls for fifteen ponies the maximum the space would hold the narrow irregular space in front is packed tight with fodder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/795.mp3	immediately behind the forecastle bulkhead is the small booby hatch the only entrance to the men's mess deck in bad weather
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/796.mp3	abaft the fore hatch is the ice house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/797.mp3	we managed to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two carcases of mutton and three carcases of beef besides some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/798.mp3	the sacks containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck cargo and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/799.mp3	forage i originally ordered thirty tons of compressed oaten hay from melbourne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/800.mp3	the scene is wholly enchanting and such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/801.mp3	a great mass of people assembled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/802.mp3	k and i lunched with a party in the new zealand company's ship ruapehu
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/803.mp3	telegram to say terra nova had arrived sunday night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/804.mp3	a third sledge stands across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after winch
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/805.mp3	the quantity is two and a half tons and the space occupied considerable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/806.mp3	the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/807.mp3	they must perforce be chained up and they are given what shelter is afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/808.mp3	it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast emits a long pathetic whine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/809.mp3	there are generally one or two on watch which eases matters but it is a squash
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/810.mp3	later in the day the wind has veered to the westward heading us slightly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/811.mp3	oates and atkinson with intermittent assistance from others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/812.mp3	there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were labouring for hours in the waist of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases et cetera in the best manner possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/813.mp3	no sooner was some semblance of order restored than some exceptionally heavy wave would tear away the lashing and the work had to be done all over again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/814.mp3	from this moment about four a m the engine room became the centre of interest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/815.mp3	the water gained in spite of every effort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/816.mp3	the outlook appeared grim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/817.mp3	the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/818.mp3	williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires what was to be done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/819.mp3	the bilge pump is dependent on the main engine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/820.mp3	on one occasion i was waist deep when standing on the rail of the poop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/821.mp3	the afterguard were organised in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps this seemed all that could be done for the moment and what a measure to count as the sole safeguard of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bale her out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/822.mp3	occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/823.mp3	now this is how arthur hunted the stag
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/824.mp3	and the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of arthur cavall was his name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/825.mp3	then they sounded the death horn for slaying and they all gathered round
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/826.mp3	one wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him and another to the lady whom he loved best
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/827.mp3	and after midday they beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse and after him a dame or a damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of large stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/828.mp3	i know not who they are said he but i know said guenever this is the knight whom geraint pursued and methinks that he comes not here by his own free will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/829.mp3	but geraint has overtaken him and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/830.mp3	lady said he at the gate there is a knight and i saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/831.mp3	i do said he he tells me that he is edeyrn the son of nudd
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/832.mp3	then she replied i know him not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/833.mp3	so guenever went to the gate to meet him and he entered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/834.mp3	and geraint greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf now where did he overtake thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/835.mp3	sir said she when thinkest thou that geraint will be here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/836.mp3	to morrow lady i think he will be here with the maiden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/837.mp3	i am lord said he and i have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/838.mp3	well said arthur from what i hear it behooves guenever to be merciful towards thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/839.mp3	the mercy which thou desirest lord said she will i grant to him since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/840.mp3	thus will it be best to do said arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/841.mp3	to guenever and her handmaidens said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/842.mp3	and the steward of the household so ordered her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/843.mp3	and being young he changed himself and grew to hate the sin that seem'd so like his own of modred arthur's nephew and fell at last in the great battle fighting for the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/844.mp3	and when geraint came to the place where guenever was he saluted her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/845.mp3	then they went in and dismounted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/846.mp3	heaven protect thee said arthur and the welcome of heaven be unto thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/847.mp3	and inasmuch as thou hast vanquished edeyrn the son of nudd thou hast had a prosperous career
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/848.mp3	and from that time she became his wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/849.mp3	and the maiden took up her abode in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/850.mp3	and a year and a second and a third he proceeded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/851.mp3	and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/852.mp3	and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent towards him and covet his land and possessions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/853.mp3	and arthur told geraint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of cornwall truly said geraint be it to my advantage or disadvantage lord i will do according to thy will concerning this embassy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/854.mp3	what discourse said guenever do i hear between you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/855.mp3	said geraint i think i shall have enough of knighthood with me and they set forth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/856.mp3	and never was there seen a fairer host journeying towards the severn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/857.mp3	and he said to geraint i am a feeble and an aged man and whilst i was able to maintain the dominion for thee and for myself i did so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/858.mp3	and every one asked that which he desired
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/859.mp3	and they were not long in giving so eager was every one to bestow gifts and of those who came to ask gifts none departed unsatisfied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/860.mp3	then geraint sent ambassadors to the men of cornwall to ask them this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/861.mp3	and they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for geraint to come and receive their homage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/862.mp3	so he received the homage of such as were there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/863.mp3	and the day after the followers of arthur intended to go away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/864.mp3	geraint as he had been used to do when he was at arthur's court frequented tournaments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/865.mp3	before geraint the scourge of the enemy i saw steeds white with foam and after the shout of battle a fearful torrent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/866.mp3	these tidings came to erbin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/867.mp3	not i by my confession unto heaven said she there is nothing more hateful unto me than this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/868.mp3	and the tears she shed and the words she had spoken awoke him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/869.mp3	and evil betide me said he if thou returnest here until thou knowest whether i have lost my strength so completely as thou didst say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/870.mp3	then geraint went to see erbin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/871.mp3	sir said he i am going upon a quest and i am not certain when i may come back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/872.mp3	take heed therefore unto thy possessions until my return
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/873.mp3	but one person only will go with me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/874.mp3	and he desired enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/875.mp3	and unless i speak unto thee say not thou one word either
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/876.mp3	and though thou shouldst desire to see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men yet do i feel no dread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/877.mp3	and he received him and that not feebly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/878.mp3	and say not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/879.mp3	i will do as far as i can lord said she according to thy desire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/880.mp3	ah maiden said he it is vain to attempt proceeding forward
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/881.mp3	i cannot by any means refrain from sleep through weariness said he do thou therefore watch the horses and sleep not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/882.mp3	and when she saw the dawn of day appear she looked around her to see if he were waking and thereupon he woke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/883.mp3	and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mowers mowing the meadows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/884.mp3	my lord he added will it be displeasing to thee if i ask whence thou comest also
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/885.mp3	wilt thou follow my counsel said the youth and take thy meal from me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/886.mp3	what sort of meal he inquired
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/887.mp3	then they washed and took their repast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/888.mp3	i go now lord said he to meet the knight and to conduct him to his lodging
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/889.mp3	i will do lord said she as thou sayest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/890.mp3	and after they had eaten and drank geraint went to sleep and so did enid also
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/891.mp3	we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/892.mp3	to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/893.mp3	but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrade's thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of kuana
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/894.mp3	here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/895.mp3	when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/896.mp3	when he saw this the ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/897.mp3	now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/898.mp3	he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed his story and pitied and tried to comfort him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/899.mp3	then the ronin said to the boatmen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/900.mp3	what think you gentlemen added he turning to the other travellers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/901.mp3	they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ronin had proposed and so the matter was settled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/902.mp3	when at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the ronin overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priest's luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to kiyoto
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/903.mp3	fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in course of time he married a wife who bore him a child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/904.mp3	since then all has gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin nor thief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/905.mp3	he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/906.mp3	at length undone by such ceaseless vexation tokubei fell ill and kept muttering oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/907.mp3	now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/908.mp3	and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/909.mp3	three years ago at the kuana ferry you flung me into the water and well you remember it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/910.mp3	happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/911.mp3	on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvellous ailment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/912.mp3	thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/913.mp3	and would it not ill become me to bear malice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/914.mp3	repent therefore and abandon your evil ways
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/915.mp3	to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/916.mp3	be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/917.mp3	in a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and rob you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/918.mp3	fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victim's vengeance would some day overtake me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/919.mp3	haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/920.mp3	but how you managed to escape and are still alive is more than i can understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/921.mp3	a guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork's beak a murderer's conscience preys upon his mind till he sees what is not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/922.mp3	every well ordered japanese home of the old fashioned kind has its little shrine which is the centre of the religious life of the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/923.mp3	she it is who sets the rice and wine before the ancestral tablets who lights the little lamp each night and who sees that at each feast day and anniversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/924.mp3	these must be kept carefully by the mother as a safeguard against the many evils that beset child life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/925.mp3	visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the child's collection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/926.mp3	all these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as queen althea kept the charred stick that governed the destiny of her son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/927.mp3	as the children arrive at years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and they are usually kept stored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/928.mp3	each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour day or year over which it presides and only a skillful balancer of pros and cons can read aright the combinations and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/929.mp3	for the greater events of family life the home prophecies are felt to be too uncertain and the services of the fortune teller must be called in
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/930.mp3	no well managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to face the front door
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/931.mp3	after this matter has been settled and the house is fairly begun there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/932.mp3	of these the most important is the day when the roof is raised
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/933.mp3	the house owner then decides whether the day set by the builder is a lucky one for himself and his family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/934.mp3	a present of money to each workman is also in order and will conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job in hand when at last the house is finished and carpenters and plasterers are ready to leave it the local firemen who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers often ascend to the roof and from the ridge pole cast down cakes for which the children of the neighborhood scramble joyfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/935.mp3	all come who can and those who cannot come send servants or provisions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/936.mp3	on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped coffin that until recently was the style commonly in use in japan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/937.mp3	now among the wealthier classes the long coffin has superseded the small square or round one but the smaller expense connected with burial in the old way makes the survival of the old type a necessity for the majority of japanese
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/938.mp3	at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/939.mp3	there is no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites or attend the funeral
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/940.mp3	upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/941.mp3	when the body has been washed it is dressed in white in silk habutai whenever the family can afford it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/942.mp3	the body to be placed in the coffin must be folded into a sitting posture the chin resting upon the knees the position of the mummies found in many aboriginal american tombs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/943.mp3	this difficult to us apparently impossible feat safely accomplished there are placed in the coffin a number of small things that the dead takes with him to the next world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/944.mp3	the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/945.mp3	last of all the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/946.mp3	so long as the coffin is in the house it must be watched over continually
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/947.mp3	it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed at regular intervals by the mourners themselves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/948.mp3	there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/949.mp3	individual instances occur in which some of the worst features of these customs are modified
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/950.mp3	a case in point is that of the late mister fukuzawa a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/951.mp3	in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/952.mp3	through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/953.mp3	just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/954.mp3	on the day of the burial great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead each bunch so large as to require the services of one man to carry it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/955.mp3	sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession but if the giver feels too poor to hire a man this burden too falls upon the bereaved household for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniformed coolies who march in the funeral train
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/956.mp3	another favorite present at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave and released thereon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/957.mp3	it seems more like a bridal than a burial
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/958.mp3	during this period the spirit of the deceased is supposed to be still inhabiting the house and a tablet or shrine is set up in the death chamber before which food and flowers are renewed daily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/959.mp3	hallo colonel how d'ye sell your wood this time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/960.mp3	why capting we must charge you three and a quarter this time the d l
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/961.mp3	supper was over and i retired to my upper berth situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/962.mp3	head her in shore then and take in six cords if it's good see to it thompson i can't very well leave the game now it's getting right warm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/963.mp3	this pilot's beating us all to smash the wooding completed we paddled on again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/964.mp3	they were anxious to learn the game and they did learn it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/965.mp3	still with all these disadvantages they continued playing they wanted to learn the game
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/966.mp3	oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/967.mp3	this wood seems rather better than that we took in at yellow face's but we're nearly out again and must be looking out for more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/968.mp3	i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/969.mp3	yes yes replied the captain ring the bell and ask em what's the price of wood up here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/970.mp3	i've got you again here's double kings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/971.mp3	deal sir if you please better luck next time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/972.mp3	the other pilot's voice was again heard on deck how much have you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/973.mp3	only about ten cords sir was the reply of the youthful salesman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/974.mp3	the captain here told thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/975.mp3	the pilots here changed places when did they sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/976.mp3	wood taken in the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length dawned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/977.mp3	i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/978.mp3	there it is exclaimed the captain stop her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/979.mp3	i accompany my granddaughter to this this entertainment her ladyship responded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/980.mp3	it is scarcely a joyous occasion to my mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/981.mp3	no need to dress yourself like that if it isn't ejaculated mister binnie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/982.mp3	if i were sure this was the same man i'd go myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/983.mp3	when i find a fellow who's neither knave nor fool i stick to him believe i'll send to find out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/984.mp3	the only time he had made any comment upon her was the first time he saw her in the dress she had copied from octavia's nice gown that he blurted out didn't get it here i'll wager
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/985.mp3	doesn't look like it he said gruffly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/986.mp3	no she answered i am not afraid at all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/987.mp3	i shall not be afraid again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/988.mp3	in fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/989.mp3	i beg you will not speak to me of that again she said i will not listen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/990.mp3	and turning about she walked out of the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/991.mp3	and nothing more had been said on the subject since
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/992.mp3	before breakfast miss belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram which ran as follows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/993.mp3	arrived to day per russia be with you tomorrow evening
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/994.mp3	friend with me martin bassett
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/995.mp3	well remarked octavia i suppose that would have been an advantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/996.mp3	octavia was a marked figure upon the grounds at that garden party another dress my dear remarked missus burnham
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/997.mp3	and what a charming color she has i declare she is usually paler
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/998.mp3	perhaps we owe this to lord lansdowne
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/999.mp3	she's prettier than ever to day and is enjoying herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1000.mp3	she was enjoying herself mister francis barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1001.mp3	and then had come lord lansdowne who in crossing the lawn to shake hands with his host had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one particular point burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that tall girl in white
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1002.mp3	and in ten minutes lady theobald missus burnham mister barold and divers others too numerous to mention saw him standing at octavia's side evidently with no intention of leaving it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1003.mp3	not long after this francis barold found his way to miss belinda who was very busy and rather nervous your niece is evidently enjoying herself he remarked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1004.mp3	octavia is most happy to day answered miss belinda
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1005.mp3	very few people understand octavia said miss belinda i'm not sure that i follow all her moods myself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1006.mp3	she is not as frivolous as she appears to those who don't know her well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1007.mp3	barold stood gnawing his mustache and made no reply he was not very comfortable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1008.mp3	he felt himself ill used by fate and rather wished he had returned to london from broadoaks instead of loitering in slowbridge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1009.mp3	he had amused himself at first but in time he had been surprised to find his amusement lose something of its zest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1010.mp3	it's deucedly bad form on his part he said mentally what does he mean by it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1011.mp3	octavia on the contrary did not ask what he meant by it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1012.mp3	where he ejaculated i say what a name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1013.mp3	i had not observed it answered her ladyship
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1014.mp3	but she glared at barold as he passed and beckoned to him where is lucia she demanded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1015.mp3	i saw her with burmistone half an hour ago he answered coldly have you any message for my mother i shall return to london to morrow leaving here early she turned quite pale
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1016.mp3	what has happened she asked rigidly he looked slightly surprised nothing whatever he replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1017.mp3	i have remained here longer than i intended
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1018.mp3	she began to move the manacles on her right wrist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1019.mp3	she had not brought lucia up under her own eye for nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1020.mp3	chapter twenty three may i go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1021.mp3	the very day after this octavia opened the fourth trunk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1022.mp3	evidently something had happened octavia she said mister dugald binnie is at oldclough who is he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1023.mp3	he is my grand uncle explained lucia tremulously he has a great deal of money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1024.mp3	i do not quite understand grandmamma octavia she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1025.mp3	last night she came to my room to talk to me and this morning she came again and oh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1026.mp3	she broke out indignantly how could she speak to me in such a manner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1027.mp3	what did you understand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1028.mp3	i am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mister binnie may leave me his money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1029.mp3	do you wonder that it took even lady theobald a long time to say that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1030.mp3	well remarked octavia you won't do it i suppose i wouldn't worry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1031.mp3	oh i always knew it i didn't guess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1032.mp3	and she smiled ever so faintly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1033.mp3	that is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1034.mp3	lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1035.mp3	octavia smiled a little again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1036.mp3	lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1037.mp3	i am glad i came here she said at length
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1038.mp3	i think i shall never be afraid of her any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1039.mp3	her delicate nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of exultation in her tone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1040.mp3	she walked very fast after she left the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1041.mp3	but it was not against him that lucia's indignation was aroused
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1042.mp3	she wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1043.mp3	he took hold of her shaking little hand and looked down at her excited face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1044.mp3	i am angry she said you have never seen me angry before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1045.mp3	i am on my way to my to lady theobald
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1046.mp3	he held her hand as calmly as before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1047.mp3	what are you going to say to her he asked she laughed again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1048.mp3	he held her hand rather closer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1049.mp3	she has made you very angry he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1050.mp3	and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1051.mp3	lucia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald you she said with a little start
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1052.mp3	yes he answered let me go to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1053.mp3	if you will say yes to that i think i can promise that you need never be afraid of her any more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1054.mp3	the fierce color died out of her cheeks and the tears rushed to her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1055.mp3	she raised her face with a pathetic look
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1056.mp3	i am desperately in love with you he answered in his quietest way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1057.mp3	a number of other dates were observed by the christian church at various times as the birthday of jesus the gospels give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1058.mp3	yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1059.mp3	why this discrepancy in a historical document to say nothing about inspiration
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1060.mp3	again matthew says that to escape the evil designs of herod mary and joseph with the infant jesus fled into egypt luke says nothing about this hurried flight nor of herod's intention to kill the infant messiah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1061.mp3	when we come to the more important chapters about jesus we meet with greater difficulties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1062.mp3	while it is always on a friday that the crucifixion is commemorated the week in which the day occurs varies from year to year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1063.mp3	good friday falls not before the spring equinox but as soon after the spring equinox as the full moon allows thus making the calculation to depend upon the position of the sun in the zodiac and the phases of the moon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1064.mp3	the pagan oestera has become the christian easter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1065.mp3	but in the absence of evidence origin offers the following metaphysical arguments against the sceptical celsus one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1066.mp3	if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the mythus of jesus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1067.mp3	the immediate companions of jesus appear to be on the other hand as mythical as he is himself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1068.mp3	who was matthew who was mark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1069.mp3	who were john peter judas and mary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1070.mp3	there is absolutely no evidence that they ever existed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1071.mp3	if peter ever went to rome with a new doctrine how is it that no historian has taken note of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1072.mp3	here again we see the presence of a myth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1073.mp3	he was the only one who saw them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1074.mp3	peter paul john james judas occupy the stage almost exclusively
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1075.mp3	it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors and historians of his time do not take notice of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1076.mp3	could they have been in a conspiracy against him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1077.mp3	how else is this unanimous silence to be accounted for
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1078.mp3	how then are we to decide which of the numerous candidates for divine honors should be given our votes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1079.mp3	and such a faith is never free it is always maintained by the sword now and by hell fire hereafter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1080.mp3	yet the most impossible utterances are put in jesus mouth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1081.mp3	only a mythical jesus could virtually hand over the government of the universe to courtiers who have petitions to press upon his attention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1082.mp3	moreover if jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1083.mp3	have these prayers been answered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1084.mp3	how many self deluded prophets these extravagant claims have produced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1085.mp3	and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1086.mp3	the same which the preachers of today give he parried his answer with many words and at length said that the promise was to be taken with the provision that what we asked for would be given if god thought it for our good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1087.mp3	but he said if ye ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1088.mp3	did he not mean just what he said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1089.mp3	self effort and not prayer is the remedy against ignorance slavery poverty and moral degradation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1090.mp3	but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth to others
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1091.mp3	but there is more of a moral tonic in the open and candid discussion of a subject like the one in hand than in a multitude of platitudes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1141.mp3	then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollo's radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerning the divine apollo

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1143.mp3	i said to him homer the inspired bard

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1155.mp3	i asked my eyes filled with wonder and my voice quivering with excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1156.mp3	would not that then i ventured to ask impatiently make jesus as much of an idol as apollo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1157.mp3	and if faith that jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith in apollo make him a god

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1159.mp3	aunt jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year old baby clinging to the other

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1163.mp3	all her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1164.mp3	but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1165.mp3	the room was small a mere box above the kitchen which sidney shared with two small cousins

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1167.mp3	just at that particular angle one eye appeared to be as large as an orange while the other was the size of a pea and the mouth zigzagged from ear to ear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1168.mp3	sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate anything

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1173.mp3	he never had done so but ellen douglas's letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1174.mp3	would she be kind enough to correspond with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1175.mp3	he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1176.mp3	sidney liked the letter and answered it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1177.mp3	she never expected to meet john lincoln nor did she wish to do so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1178.mp3	in the correspondence itself she found her pleasure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1179.mp3	john lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains so alien and remote from snug humdrum plainfield life that sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the bar n as for sidney's own letter this is the way it read as she wrote it

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1183.mp3	as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it but his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the insight he himself has given me

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1202.mp3	oh i didn't mean to deceive you i never thought of such a thing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1203.mp3	i just couldn't write you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1204.mp3	and when once i had begun i had to keep it up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1205.mp3	i found it so fascinating too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1206.mp3	those letters made that other life seem real to me i never expected to meet you

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1217.mp3	you you'll forgive me then she stammered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1218.mp3	it's a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher isn't it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1219.mp3	penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasn't gone anywhere thought the older sister wistfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1220.mp3	doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1221.mp3	so it must be confessed did penelope though she would not have admitted it for the world
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1222.mp3	she knew that penelope had started out to say a new dress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1223.mp3	doris hunter i believe it's an old quilt

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1227.mp3	i don't see its beauty said penelope with a grimace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1228.mp3	it may have been pretty once but it is all faded now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1229.mp3	tell me dorrie does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that i can't feel very enthusiastic over this heirloom especially when grandmother hunter died years before i was born
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1230.mp3	it was very kind of aunt adella to send it said doris dutifully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1231.mp3	why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right exclaimed penelope
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1232.mp3	what lovely old timey stuff and not a bit faded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1233.mp3	i declare it is as good as new
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1234.mp3	well let us go and have tea said penelope i'm decidedly hungry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1235.mp3	besides i see the poverty pucker coming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1236.mp3	it is something to possess an heirloom after all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1237.mp3	penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heart could wish when doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of dainty rose besprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1238.mp3	so penelope went to blanche's party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1239.mp3	penelope thought her altogether charming
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1240.mp3	she looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1241.mp3	my aunt adella gave me gave us the material she stammered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1242.mp3	i am named after her missus fairweather suddenly put her arm about penelope and drew the young girl to her her lovely old face aglow with delight and tenderness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1243.mp3	then you are my grandniece she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1244.mp3	when i saw your dress i felt sure you were related to her i should recognize that rosebud silk if i came across it in thibet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1245.mp3	penelope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1246.mp3	soon after this our mother died and our household was broken up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1247.mp3	my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1248.mp3	now she patted missus fairweather's soft old hand affectionately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1249.mp3	doris and penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1252.mp3	what has happened mister prince wadsworth asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited governor andros has come again gasped mister prince why should that alarm us the fellow though given to boasting is not dangerous or liable to put his threats into execution but he has grown dangerous declared mister prince the liberties of the colony are involved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1253.mp3	captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1254.mp3	we have stubbornly refused to yield our charter voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1255.mp3	that is true captain wadsworth continued mister prince and to subdue our stubbornness this viceroy has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1256.mp3	captain wadsworth bounded to his feet in a rage and placing his hand on the hilt of his sword declared he shall not have it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1257.mp3	the day was well nigh spent when he arrived and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1258.mp3	he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1259.mp3	after the captain had taken two or three turns across the room he paused and asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1260.mp3	what is the assembly doing engaged in a debate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1261.mp3	and will he wait until it has ended he has promised to do so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1262.mp3	mister prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captain's face and read there a desperate determination captain he began
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1263.mp3	mister prince bowed and hastily returned to the house where the assembly was in session
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1264.mp3	as soon as he was gone charles stevens said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1265.mp3	yes charles you will answer what do you mean uncle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1266.mp3	never did debaters take greater interest in a minor subject
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1267.mp3	what do you intend doing uncle will you fight them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1268.mp3	remember the work must be done right at the time not too soon nor too late
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1269.mp3	the sun was setting and the captain said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1270.mp3	come charles let us hasten to the assembly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1271.mp3	by no means but i want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1272.mp3	take your place charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain wadsworth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1273.mp3	charles got as close to the long table used by the secretaries as possible without attracting special attention
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1274.mp3	the discussion went on darkness came and four lighted candles were placed on the table and two set on a shelf on the wall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1275.mp3	those two candles on the wall were a great annoyance to charles until he saw a man stationed near them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1276.mp3	though the lights were extinguished through the windows the faint starlight dimly illuminated the scene
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1277.mp3	he followed him as rapidly as he could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1278.mp3	the youth was close behind him and when they were outside seized his arm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1279.mp3	boy have a care how you approach me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1280.mp3	the soldiers began to crowd about the house when at a signal from captain wadsworth the train bands came on the scene and prepared to grapple with the soldiers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1281.mp3	where is the charter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1282.mp3	you have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1283.mp3	who of you has the charter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1284.mp3	it was the boy cried the enraged governor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1285.mp3	every member of the assembly shook their heads
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1286.mp3	we do not know him he does not live in connecticut where does he live
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1287.mp3	little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1288.mp3	the tree in which the document was hidden was ever afterward known as the charter oak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1289.mp3	it remained vigorous bearing fruit every year until a little after midnight august eighteen fifty six when it was prostrated by a heavy storm of wind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1290.mp3	when the order for the seizure of the charters was first made known the assembly of rhode island sent a most loyal address to the king saying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1291.mp3	he formally dissolved the assembly broke the seal of the colony which bore the figure of an anchor and the word hope admitted five of the inhabitants into his legislative council and assumed the functions of governor but he did not take away the parchment on which the charter was written
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1292.mp3	from that time until the enforced union of the colonies for mutual defence at the breaking out of the french and indian war the inhabitants of rhode island bore their share in the defensive efforts especially when the hostile savages hung along the frontiers of new york like an ill omened cloud
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1293.mp3	the history of that commonwealth is identified with that of all new england from the beginning of king william's war soon after to the expulsion of andros
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1294.mp3	i don't know how to say good by to you nellie told dorothy and nan next morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1295.mp3	oh that will be splendid declared nan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1296.mp3	you are quite rich now aren't you remarked dorothy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1297.mp3	and dorothy went up and down the room like the pictures of cinderella's proud sisters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1298.mp3	and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1299.mp3	come nellie called missus mc laughlin i am ready where is your hat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1300.mp3	we might be able to manage that too nellie told him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1301.mp3	my uncle is a fireman and he can take us through his engine house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1302.mp3	most of them i guess answered bert
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1303.mp3	well we have had a good vacation and i am willing to go to work again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1304.mp3	so am i declared nan vacation was just long enough i think
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1305.mp3	mister bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddie and flossie were busy packing up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1306.mp3	there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and snoop the cat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1307.mp3	and so our little friends had spent all their vacation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1308.mp3	a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1309.mp3	and everybody was so happy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1310.mp3	the neptune the vessel that had struck on the sand bar was now safely anchored near shore and the sailors came in and out in row boats back and forth to land just as they wished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1311.mp3	then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1312.mp3	that was what delayed us so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1313.mp3	finally we had every log loaded on the schooner and we started off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1314.mp3	we counted on getting home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1315.mp3	about the value asked mister bobbsey who was down from the city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1316.mp3	the value repeated the captain aside so that the strangers might not hear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1317.mp3	well i'm a rich man now and so is my mate mc laughlin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1318.mp3	yes indeed it would have taken us a lifetime to accumulate as much money as we have earned in this year
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1319.mp3	maybe aunt emily will take you down to the city on her shopping tour suggested nan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1320.mp3	he made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and i guess everybody was glad the army fell down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1321.mp3	the wonderful fresh air that these men lived in night and day had brightened their eyes too so that even the plainest face and the most awkward man among them was as nimble as an athlete from his perfect exercise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1322.mp3	called bert who had heard his uncle getting ready to run down to the water's edge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1323.mp3	it's a schooner said mister bingham to mister minturn and she has a very heavy cargo
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1324.mp3	to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or cable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1325.mp3	what's that board for asked bert as he saw a board following the cable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1326.mp3	that's the directions said hal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1327.mp3	they are printed in a number of languages and they tell the crew to carry the end of the cable high up the mast and fasten it strongly there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1328.mp3	oh i see said bert the line will stretch then and the breeches buoy will go out on a pulley
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1329.mp3	it was clear day now and much of the wicked storm had passed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1330.mp3	with the daylight came girls and women to the beach
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1331.mp3	missus bobbsey missus minturn nellie and her mother besides dorothy and nan were all there flossie and freddie being obliged to stay home with dinah and susan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1332.mp3	of course the girls asked all sorts of questions and bert and hal tried to answer them as best they could
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1333.mp3	it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1334.mp3	nearer and nearer it came until now a man's head could be seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1335.mp3	the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1336.mp3	a big roller dashing in finished the work for the life guards and a man in the cork belt bounded upon shore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1337.mp3	everybody gathered around and nellie with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1338.mp3	oh it is my father she screamed falling right into the arms of the drenched man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1339.mp3	but the half drowned man rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe them then the next minute he pressed his little daughter to his heart unable to speak a word
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1340.mp3	and is george bingham out there anxiously asked the brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1341.mp3	safe and well came the welcome answer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1342.mp3	i guess our prayers were heard last night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1343.mp3	here comes another man exclaimed the people as this time a big man dashed on the sands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1344.mp3	well i declare we did land on a friendly shore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1345.mp3	just as mister bingham said the life saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nellie's father and hal's uncle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1346.mp3	and hal and his father too put in nan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1347.mp3	what a morning that was at sunset beach
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1348.mp3	i'm so glad we prayed said little flossie to freddie when she heard the good news
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1349.mp3	in one corner of the little room kenneth forbes squatted upon a bench with an empty pine box held carelessly in his lap
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1350.mp3	while duncan worked the boy was busy with his pencil but neither had spoken for at least a half hour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1351.mp3	then riding slowly up the hedge bordered road his troubles once more assailed him and he wondered if there was not some spot upon the broad earth to which he could fly for retirement until the girls had left elmhurst for good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1352.mp3	nora shied and he looked up to discover that he had nearly run down a pedestrian a stout little man with a bundle under his arm who held up one hand as if to arrest him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1353.mp3	where do you want to go asked the boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1354.mp3	then it's the same jane as ever he responded with a shake of his grizzled head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1355.mp3	do you know i sort o hoped she'd reformed and i'd be glad to see her again they tell me she's got money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1356.mp3	aunt jane's rich aunt jane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1357.mp3	echoed the man quickly what's your name lad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1358.mp3	don't like girls i take it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1359.mp3	another long pause then the boy suddenly turned questioner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1360.mp3	you know aunt miss merrick sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1361.mp3	i used to when we were both younger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1362.mp3	kenneth stopped short and the mare stopped and the little man with a whimsical smile at the boy's astonishment also stopped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1363.mp3	john merrick that's me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1364.mp3	you were the tinsmith
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1365.mp3	they kept track of her because she suddenly became rich and a great lady and that was a surprising thing to happen to a merrick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1366.mp3	thank you lad returned the man gratefully i thought a little exercise would do me good but this three miles has seemed like thirty to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1367.mp3	i will said the man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1368.mp3	the boy turned away but in a moment halted again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1369.mp3	his interest in miss jane's brother john was extraordinary
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1370.mp3	there's little danger in this quarter i'm sure so i may as well be friends with the poor child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1371.mp3	ah why not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1372.mp3	beth hesitated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1373.mp3	the letter asking me to visit her was the first i have ever received from her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1374.mp3	but since she asked me to visit her we judged she had softened and might wish to become friendly and so i accepted the invitation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1375.mp3	surely two girls will have a better time in this lonely old place than one could have alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1376.mp3	oh yes she has corrected louise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1377.mp3	you mean patricia doyle yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1378.mp3	then we may conclude she's left out of the arrangement said beth calmly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1379.mp3	you'll fight for your chance and fight mighty hard
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1380.mp3	why my dear cousin i don't want aunt jane's money
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1381.mp3	my mother and i are amply provided for and i am only here to find rest from my social duties and to get acquainted with my dead father's sister that is all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1382.mp3	my father teaches music and mother scolds him continually for not being able to earn enough money to keep out of debt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1383.mp3	we've never seen a cent of her money although father has tried at times to borrow enough to help him out of his difficulties
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1384.mp3	i even kissed her when she asked me to and it sent a shiver all down my back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1385.mp3	for my part i am fond of everyone and it delights me to fuss around invalids and assist them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1386.mp3	you say you like to care for invalids and i don't
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1387.mp3	you're trying to make me think you don't want elmhurst when you're as anxious to get it as i am
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1388.mp3	they call me beth sullenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1389.mp3	i couldn't live in this out of the way corner of the world you know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1390.mp3	but suppose she leaves it to you persisted beth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1391.mp3	louise seemed to meditate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1392.mp3	it's a magnificent estate said beth looking at her cousin doubtfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1393.mp3	now shall we be friends she asked lightly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1394.mp3	to be sure i should want you to my dear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1395.mp3	such a girl friend it had never been her privilege to have before and when her suspicions were forgotten she became fairly responsive and brightened wonderfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1396.mp3	silas she said when he entered what do you think of my nieces
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1397.mp3	they are very charming girls he answered although they are at an age when few girls show to good advantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1398.mp3	why did you not invite kenneth to dinner jane the boy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1399.mp3	he is constantly saying disagreeable things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1400.mp3	very well said the lawyer quietly which of my nieces do you prefer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1401.mp3	asked the old lady after a pause i cannot say on so short an acquaintance he answered with gravity which do you prefer jane
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1402.mp3	they are equally unsatisfactory she answered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1403.mp3	i cannot imagine elmhurst belonging to either silas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1404.mp3	i must see that other niece the one who defies me and refuses to answer my second letter

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1440.mp3	when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1458.mp3	the dwarf's tastes however were catholic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1459.mp3	but quilp and brass were not in society
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1460.mp3	there were still plenty of active opponents and denouncers of tobacco
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1461.mp3	one of the most distinguished was the great duke of wellington who abominated smoking and was annoyed by the increase of cigar smoking among officers of the army
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1462.mp3	the ladies had a keen scent for the abominable odour of tobacco and distrusted the men who smoked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1463.mp3	here is fitz boodle's or thackeray's comment on it what is this smoking that it should be considered a crime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1464.mp3	i believe in my heart that women are jealous of it as of a rival
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1465.mp3	i would lay a guinea that many a lady who has just been kind enough to read the above lines lays down the book after this confession of mine that i am a smoker and says oh the vulgar wretch and passes on to something else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1466.mp3	germany has been puffing for three score years france smokes to a man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1467.mp3	psha look at his progress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1468.mp3	thus the odour of tobacco was not brought into the drawing room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1469.mp3	the journalists and bohemians who met at the cogers were above or below the dictates of fashion and smoking was always a feature of their gatherings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1470.mp3	both queen victoria and the prince consort detested it so tobacco was taboo wherever the court was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1471.mp3	the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1472.mp3	seats were brought in and so was the tea
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1473.mp3	the officers gazed with surprise at pierre's huge stout figure and listened to his talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1474.mp3	so you understand the whole position of our troops
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1475.mp3	not being a military man i can't say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1476.mp3	well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1477.mp3	and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1478.mp3	pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1479.mp3	we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1480.mp3	why so asked pierre
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1481.mp3	then why was it forbidden
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1482.mp3	at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1483.mp3	he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1484.mp3	so it has been with barclay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1485.mp3	while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1486.mp3	and they say he's a skillful commander rejoined pierre
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1487.mp3	i don't understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1488.mp3	a skillful commander replied pierre
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1489.mp3	pierre looked at him in surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1490.mp3	and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1491.mp3	the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1492.mp3	success never depends and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers and least of all on position but on what then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1493.mp3	on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and in each soldier
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1494.mp3	a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1495.mp3	why did we lose the battle at austerlitz
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1496.mp3	we've lost so let us run and we ran
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1497.mp3	but tomorrow we shan't say it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1498.mp3	but what awaits us tomorrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1499.mp3	the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters but hinder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1500.mp3	that's the truth the real truth said timokhin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1501.mp3	it's not the day for that they say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1502.mp3	all were silent the officers rose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1503.mp3	yes yes answered prince andrew absently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1504.mp3	the french have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me every moment they are my enemies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1505.mp3	in my opinion they are all criminals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1506.mp3	and so thinks timokhin and the whole army
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1507.mp3	since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been said at tilsit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1508.mp3	yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1509.mp3	they talk to us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on it's all rubbish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1510.mp3	they plunder other people's houses issue false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1511.mp3	take no prisoners but kill and be killed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1512.mp3	prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1513.mp3	he paced up and down a few times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1514.mp3	and when there was a war like this one it would be war
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1515.mp3	what is needed for success in warfare
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1516.mp3	and in spite of all this it is the highest class respected by everyone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1517.mp3	how does god above look at them and hear them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1518.mp3	i see that i have begun to understand too much
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1519.mp3	and it doesn't do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well it's not for long he added
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1520.mp3	however you're sleepy and it's time for me to sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1521.mp3	go back to gorki said prince andrew suddenly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1522.mp3	go go before a battle one must have one's sleep out repeated prince andrew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1523.mp3	no he does not want it pierre concluded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1524.mp3	and i know that this is our last meeting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1525.mp3	one picture succeeded another in his imagination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1526.mp3	on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1527.mp3	at this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the drip drip drip of eaves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1528.mp3	we had every sort of people with us off and on and as i was lookout at a popular game i saw them all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1529.mp3	at the same instant i heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1530.mp3	then i scouted to see what had cut me and found that the fellow had lost a hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1531.mp3	in place of it he wore a sharp steel hook
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1532.mp3	there was no doubt of his being alive for he was breathing hard like a man does when he gets hit over the head it didn't sound good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1533.mp3	when a man breathes that way he's mostly all gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1534.mp3	men got batted over the head often enough in those days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1535.mp3	sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal but it's no soothing syrup
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1536.mp3	their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea blow high blow low what care we and the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea down on the coast of the high barbaree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1537.mp3	it fair made my hair rise to hear him with the big still solemn desert outside and the quiet moonlight and the shadows and him sitting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1538.mp3	however i made out to get him bandaged up and in shape and pretty soon he sort of went to sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1539.mp3	then again he'd sing that barbaree song until i'd go out and look at the old colorado flowing by just to be sure i hadn't died and gone below or else he'd just talk
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1540.mp3	he began when he was a kid and he gave his side of conversations pausing for replies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1541.mp3	i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was or where he'd come from or what he'd done
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1542.mp3	i didn't pay any attention to him for he was quiet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1543.mp3	usually i didn't bother with his talk for it didn't mean anything but something in his voice made me turn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1544.mp3	he was lying on his side those black eyes of his blazing at me but now both of them saw the same distance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1545.mp3	where are my clothes he asked very intense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1546.mp3	one little squeeze talk about your deadly weapons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1547.mp3	but he'd been too sick and too long abed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1548.mp3	in a minute or so he came to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1549.mp3	now you're a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1550.mp3	they're safe enough let me have them he begged
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1551.mp3	now look here said i you can't get up to day you ain't fit
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1552.mp3	i know he pleaded but let me see them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1553.mp3	just to satisfy him i passed over his old duds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1554.mp3	i've been robbed he cried
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1555.mp3	where's my coat he asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1556.mp3	you had no coat when i picked you up i replied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1557.mp3	he looked at me mighty suspicious but didn't say anything more he wouldn't even answer when i spoke to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1558.mp3	after he'd eaten a fair meal he fell asleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1559.mp3	when i came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1560.mp3	i didn't see him again for two days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1561.mp3	then i caught sight of him quite a ways off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1562.mp3	guess he suspicions i stole that old coat of his thinks i and afterwards i found that my surmise had been correct
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1563.mp3	however he didn't stay long in that frame of mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1564.mp3	i ran up pulling my gun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1565.mp3	the mex was flat on his face his arms stretched out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1566.mp3	on the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1567.mp3	anyway i thrust the muzzle of my colt's into the sailor's face what's this i asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1568.mp3	i ween heem at monte off antonio curvez said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1569.mp3	the gleam died from his eye the snarl left his lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1570.mp3	in any case he flew poco pronto leaving me and my friend together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1571.mp3	during the next two months he was a good deal about town mostly doing odd jobs i saw him off and on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1572.mp3	however i didn't pay much attention to that being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1573.mp3	that's all right said i but you better stay right there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1574.mp3	i want to make up to you for your trouble said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1575.mp3	what kind of a good thing i asked treasure said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1576.mp3	he looked all right enough neither drunk nor loco
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1577.mp3	sit down said i over there the other side the table
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1578.mp3	he did so now fire away said i
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1579.mp3	and it's a big thing said handy solomon to me for they's not only gold but altar jewels and diamonds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1580.mp3	it will make us rich and a dozen like us and you can kiss the book on that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1581.mp3	that may all be true said i but why do you tell me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1582.mp3	why don't you get your treasure without the need of dividing it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1583.mp3	why mate he answered it's just plain gratitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1584.mp3	didn't you save my life and nuss me and take care of me when i was nigh killed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1585.mp3	look here anderson or handy solomon or whatever you please to call yourself i rejoined to this if you're going to do business with me and i do not understand yet just what it is you want of me you'll have to talk straight
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1586.mp3	it's all very well to say gratitude but that don't go with me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1587.mp3	the devil's a preacher if you ain't lost your pinfeathers said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1588.mp3	well it's this then i got to have a boat to get there and she must be stocked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1589.mp3	and i got to have help with the treasure if it's like this fellow said it was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1590.mp3	it's money i got to have and it's money i haven't got and can't get unless i let somebody in as pardner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1591.mp3	why me i asked why not he retorted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1592.mp3	we talked the matter over at length
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1593.mp3	i stood out for a larger party
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1594.mp3	he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally we compromised
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1595.mp3	a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the men whom i should select this scheme did not appeal to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1596.mp3	but since there existed for us no responsibility we each reported dutifully at the roll call of habit and dropped back into our blankets with a grateful sigh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1597.mp3	i remember the moon sailing a good gait among apparently stationary cloudlets i recall a deep black shadow lying before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the stark motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with the bellowing of cattle in the corrals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1598.mp3	seemingly but a moment later the cook's howl brought me to consciousness again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1599.mp3	three were to care for the remuda five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1600.mp3	the rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1601.mp3	we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards distant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1602.mp3	between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle and near the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1603.mp3	we pushed open the wide gate and entered
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1604.mp3	one stood waiting for them to finish a sheaf of long j h stamping irons in his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1605.mp3	all the rest squatted on their heels along the fence smoking cigarettes and chatting together
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1606.mp3	the first rays of the sun slanted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1607.mp3	homer wooden and old california john rode in among the cattle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1608.mp3	as the loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1609.mp3	homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn and sat over in one stirrup to avoid the tightened line and to preserve the balance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1610.mp3	nobody paid any attention to the calf
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1611.mp3	behind him followed his anxious mother her head swinging from side to side near the fire the horse stopped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1612.mp3	the two bull doggers immediately pounced upon the victim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1613.mp3	it was promptly flopped over on its right side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1614.mp3	thus the calf was unable to struggle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1615.mp3	when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a rib or two broken you cease to think this unnecessarily rough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1616.mp3	hot iron yelled one of the bull doggers
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1617.mp3	marker yelled the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1618.mp3	the brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1619.mp3	perhaps the calf blatted a little as the heat scorched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1620.mp3	the brand showed cherry which is the proper colour to indicate due peeling and a successful mark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1621.mp3	then he nicked out a swallow tail in the other
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1622.mp3	it seems to me that a great deal of unnecessary twaddle is abroad as to the extreme cruelty of branding
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1623.mp3	undoubtedly it is to some extent painful and could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopt it in preference
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1624.mp3	inextinguishable laughter followed the spread of this doctrine through arizona
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1625.mp3	imagine a puncher descending to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range or in a round up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1626.mp3	a calf usually bellows when the iron bites but as soon as released he almost invariably goes to feeding or to looking idly about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1627.mp3	besides which it happens but once in a lifetime and is over in ten seconds a comfort denied to those of us who have our teeth filled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1628.mp3	one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tossed his loop over its neck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1629.mp3	mister frost's bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1630.mp3	and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehending excitement and the absolute matter of fact imperturbability of horse and rider
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1631.mp3	as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with a whack and was pounced upon and held
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1632.mp3	he would catch himself on one foot scramble vigorously and end by struggling back to the upright
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1633.mp3	you can imagine what happened next
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1634.mp3	this is productive of some fun if it fails
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1635.mp3	by now the branding was in full swing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1636.mp3	when the nooses fell they turned and walked toward the fire as a matter of course rarely did the cast fail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1637.mp3	men ran to and fro busy and intent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1638.mp3	sometimes three or four calves were on the ground at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1639.mp3	dust eddied and dissipated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1640.mp3	no more necked calves they announced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1641.mp3	then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1642.mp3	if luck attended his first effort his sarcasm was profound there's yore little calf said he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1643.mp3	would you like to have me tote it to you or do you reckon you could toddle this far with yore little old iron
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1644.mp3	toward noon the work slacked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1645.mp3	finally homer rode over to the cattleman and reported the branding finished
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1646.mp3	the latter counted the marks in his tally book
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1647.mp3	one hundred and seventy six he announced
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1648.mp3	the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits of ears they had saved
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1649.mp3	the total amounted to but an hundred and seventy five
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1650.mp3	finally wooden discovered it in his hip pocket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1651.mp3	they had been doing a wrestler's heavy work all the morning but did not seem to be tired
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1652.mp3	i saw once in some crank physical culture periodical that a cowboy's life was physically ill balanced like an oarsman's in that it exercised only certain muscles of the body

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1654.mp3	the vehicle which he chose was that of a periodical paper which he knew had been upon former occasions employed with great success
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1655.mp3	when i was to begin publishing that paper i was at a loss how to name it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1656.mp3	i sat down at night upon my bedside and resolved that i would not go to sleep till i had fixed its title

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1688.mp3	two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1689.mp3	oh i'm sure i heard it raging up and down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1690.mp3	i don't want any dinner said charlotte drawing back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1691.mp3	yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1692.mp3	assuredly said old mister king with great satisfaction in polly's pleasure and at her success in drawing charlotte out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1693.mp3	and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1694.mp3	oh bless me it's you phronsie in pleased surprise
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1695.mp3	yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting the door carefully i came on purpose to see you all alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1696.mp3	so you did dear said mister king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1697.mp3	oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in a rapture i could never be too big for that so she perched up as of old on his knee then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1698.mp3	well my dear what is it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1699.mp3	asked the old gentleman presently you've come to tell me something i suppose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1700.mp3	yes grandpapa i have said phronsie decidedly and it is most important too grandpapa and oh i do wish it so much and she clasped her hands tighter and sighed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1701.mp3	well then phronsie if you want it i suppose it must be said mister king quite as a matter of course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1702.mp3	oh she left you everything she had phronsie a couple of millions or so it is why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1703.mp3	charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1704.mp3	why no not exactly her father isn't rich but charlotte i think may do very well especially as i intend to keep her here for a while and then i shall never let her suffer phronsie never indeed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1705.mp3	grandpapa said phronsie wasn't missus chatterton aunt to charlotte
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1706.mp3	if missus chatterton was aunt to charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money it really does grandpapa
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1707.mp3	maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldn't wonder if cousin eunice was sorry over a few other things too phronsie

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1715.mp3	not to be ungracious the young man threw himself into a chair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1716.mp3	oh hang it uncle why can't you let me alone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1717.mp3	which is a wonder interpolated pickering

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1719.mp3	for heaven's sake pickering cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its restless occupant don't say that again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1720.mp3	i've been a lazy dog all my life and a good for naught but i hope i've not sunk to that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1721.mp3	the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1722.mp3	where is he pete miss billy gasped the old man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1723.mp3	aunt hannah's cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billy's name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1724.mp3	it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1725.mp3	retorted aunt hannah testily as if you yourself didn't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1726.mp3	interposed billy tell mister bertram i am here or wait i'll go right in and surprise him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1727.mp3	pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1728.mp3	miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1729.mp3	it'll be all right now all right he's in the den miss billy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1730.mp3	billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hannah's indignant voice arrested her billy stop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1731.mp3	pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pete's lips twitched
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1732.mp3	but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1733.mp3	a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1734.mp3	dong ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1735.mp3	in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1736.mp3	then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1737.mp3	as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1738.mp3	why of of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1739.mp3	demanded bertram angry and mystified
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1740.mp3	as for my not painting again you didn't understand pete dearie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1741.mp3	she pulled herself half away from bertram's encircling arm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1742.mp3	billy drew a quivering sigh
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1743.mp3	good heavens is kate in this too bertram's voice was savage now
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1744.mp3	well she wrote a letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1745.mp3	billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1746.mp3	and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1747.mp3	he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1748.mp3	billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwright's
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1749.mp3	after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1750.mp3	you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1751.mp3	and and you didn't care specially for for miss winthrop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1752.mp3	billy put a soft finger on his lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1753.mp3	bertram kissed the finger and subsided humph he commented
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1754.mp3	well what is that is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1755.mp3	there was another silence then suddenly bertram stirred
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1756.mp3	billy i'm going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1757.mp3	i don't know as i can trust you out of my sight till then you'll read something or hear something or get a letter from kate after breakfast to morrow morning that will set you saving me again and i don't want to be saved that way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1758.mp3	i'm going to marry you to morrow i'll get he stopped short with a sudden frown confound that law i forgot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1759.mp3	five days indeed sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1760.mp3	i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1761.mp3	don't want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly i saw marie get ready and i had all i wanted of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1762.mp3	if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings we'll do it afterwards not before but
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1763.mp3	besides i need you to take care of me cut in bertram craftily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1764.mp3	the tender glow on billy's face told its own story and bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1765.mp3	sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1766.mp3	billy my dear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1767.mp3	it was aunt hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1768.mp3	we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1769.mp3	you mean it'll be before october
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1770.mp3	aunt hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1771.mp3	yes nodded billy demurely
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1772.mp3	yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram airily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1773.mp3	we wanted it to morrow but we had to wait on account of the new license law
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1774.mp3	the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking of the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1775.mp3	and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1776.mp3	raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1777.mp3	the christians of raymond stood condemned by the result
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1778.mp3	for that had been the fact in raymond for years the saloon ruled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1779.mp3	president marsh sat there his usual erect handsome firm bright self confident bearing all gone his head bowed upon his breast the great tears rolling down his cheeks unmindful of the fact that never before had he shown outward emotion in a public service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1780.mp3	what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1781.mp3	when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1782.mp3	what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1783.mp3	they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1784.mp3	the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirit's presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whiskey power in raymond that would break its reign forever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1785.mp3	since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1786.mp3	and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1787.mp3	gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreen's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1788.mp3	gray had gone up to virginia's and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1789.mp3	i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said gray whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its great sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i do not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honor what do you think mister maxwell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1790.mp3	i will be guided by your judgment in the matter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1791.mp3	i am sure that whatever you and miss page think best will be right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1792.mp3	under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times but this seems different
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1793.mp3	it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through raymond on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1794.mp3	she was a common street drunkard and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1795.mp3	it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1796.mp3	mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1797.mp3	raymond of course being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1798.mp3	then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1799.mp3	it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1800.mp3	there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1801.mp3	he ceased
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1802.mp3	where where is sita
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1803.mp3	scorched by the fiery god of day high on this mighty hill i lay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1804.mp3	each morn and eve he brought me food and filial care my life renewed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1805.mp3	swift to the south his course he bent and cleft the yielding element
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1806.mp3	the holy spirits of the air came round me as i marvelled there and cried as their bright legions met o say is sita living yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1807.mp3	thus cried the saints and told the name of him who held the struggling dame
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1808.mp3	then from the flood sampati paid due offerings to his brother's shade
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1809.mp3	seven nights in deadly swoon i passed but struggling life returned at last
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1810.mp3	around i bent my wondering view but every spot was strange and new
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1811.mp3	but this thy host so wide dispread wakes in my heart one doubt and dread lest threatening rama good and great ill thoughts thy journey stimulate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1812.mp3	he is my eldest brother he is like a father dear to me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1813.mp3	i go to lead my brother thence who makes the wood his residence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1814.mp3	no thought but this thy heart should frame this simple truth my lips proclaim
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1815.mp3	as guha thus and bharat each to other spoke in friendly speech the day god sank with glory dead and night o'er all the sky was spread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1816.mp3	soon as king guha's thoughtful care had quartered all the army there well honoured bharat laid his head beside satrughna on a bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1817.mp3	thus sighing and distressed in misery and bitter grief with fevered heart that mocked relief distracted in his mind the chief still mourned and found no rest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1818.mp3	rest duteous minded i will keep my watch while rama lies asleep for in the whole wide world is none dearer to me than raghu's son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1819.mp3	harbour no doubt or jealous fear i speak the truth with heart sincere for from the grace which he has shown will glory on my name be thrown great store of merit shall i gain and duteous form no wish in vain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1820.mp3	let me enforced by many a row of followers armed with shaft and bow for well loved rama's weal provide who lies asleep by sita's side
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1821.mp3	with words like these i spoke designed to move the high souled bharat's mind but he upon his duty bent plied his persuasive argument o how can slumber close mine eyes when lowly couched with sita lies the royal rama
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1822.mp3	he whom no mighty demon no nor heavenly god can overthrow see guha how he lies alas with sita couched on gathered grass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1823.mp3	now as his son is forced to fly the king ere long will surely die reft of his guardian hand forlorn in widowed grief this land will mourn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1824.mp3	but ah for sad kausalya how fare she and mine own mother now how fares the king
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1825.mp3	with hopes upon satrughna set my mother may survive as yet but the sad queen will die who bore the hero for her grief is sore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1826.mp3	too late the king will cry and conquered by his misery die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1827.mp3	when fate has brought the mournful day which sees my father pass away how happy in their lives are they allowed his funeral rites to pay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1828.mp3	thus bharat stood with many a sigh lamenting and the night went by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1829.mp3	when guha saw the long armed chief whose eye was like a lotus leaf with lion shoulders strong and fair high mettled prostrate in despair pale bitterly afflicted he reeled as in earthquake reels a tree
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1830.mp3	kausalya by her woe oppressed the senseless bharat's limbs caressed as a fond cow in love and fear caresses oft her youngling dear then yielding to her woe she said weeping and sore disquieted what torments o my son are these of sudden pain or swift disease
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1831.mp3	the lives of us and all the line depend dear child on only thine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1832.mp3	rama and lakshman forced to flee i live by naught but seeing thee for as the king has past away thou art my only help to day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1833.mp3	show me the couch whereon he lay tell me the food he ate i pray
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1834.mp3	then calm and still absorbed in thought he drank the water lakshman brought and then obedient to his vows he fasted with his gentle spouse
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1835.mp3	here stands the tree which lent them shade here is the grass beneath it laid where rama and his consort spent the night together ere they went
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1836.mp3	on comrades to the cave i cried and all within the portal hied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1837.mp3	here thou with hospitable care hast fed us with the noblest fare preserving us about to die with this thy plentiful supply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1838.mp3	but how o pious lady say may we thy gracious boon repay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1839.mp3	he ceased the ascetic dame replied well vanars am i satisfied
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1840.mp3	a life of holy works i lead and from your hands no service need
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1841.mp3	then spake again the vanar chief we came to thee and found relief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1842.mp3	now listen to a new distress and aid us holy votaress
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1843.mp3	our wanderings in this vasty cave exhaust the time sugriva gave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1844.mp3	once more then lady grant release and let thy suppliants go in peace again upon their errand sped for king sugriva's ire we dread
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1845.mp3	and the great task our sovereign set alas is unaccomplished yet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1846.mp3	and heard his waters roar and rave terrific with each crested wave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1847.mp3	the month is lost in toil and pain and now my friends what hopes remain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1848.mp3	your hearts with strong affection fraught his weal in every labour sought and the true valour of your band was blazoned wide in every land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1849.mp3	come let us all from food abstain and perish thus since hope is vain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1850.mp3	far better thus to end our lives and leave our wealth our homes and wives leave our dear little ones and all than by his vengeful hand to fall
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1851.mp3	our forfeit lives will surely pay for idle search and long delay and our fierce king will bid us die the favour of his friend to buy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1852.mp3	then tara softly spake to cheer the vanars hearts oppressed by fear despair no more your doubts dispel come in this ample cavern dwell
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1853.mp3	thou fondly hopest in this cave the vengeance of the foe to brave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1854.mp3	but lakshman's arm a shower will send of deadly shafts those walls to rend
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1855.mp3	thy loving kinsman true and wise looks on thee still with favouring eyes

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1898.mp3	the deeds and conduct of an individual and of a nation may be very much modified through dogmas example and custom
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1899.mp3	with an equal degree of wickedness one man may die on the wheel and another in the bosom of his family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1900.mp3	it is conceivable that a perfect state or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believed doctrine of rewards and punishments after death might prevent every crime politically much would be gained thereby morally nothing only the expression of the will in life would be restricted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1901.mp3	we who here seek the theory of virtue and have therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation will yet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1902.mp3	he sees that the distinction between himself and others which to the bad man is so great a gulf only belongs to a fleeting and illusive phenomenon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1903.mp3	he recognises himself his will in every being and consequently also in the sufferer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1904.mp3	but the latter is the necessary and inevitable symptom of that knowledge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1905.mp3	the opposite of the sting of conscience the origin and significance of which is explained above is the good conscience the satisfaction which we experience after every disinterested deed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1906.mp3	the good man lives in a world of friendly individuals the well being of any of whom he regards as his own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1907.mp3	therefore although the knowledge of the lot of mankind generally does not make his disposition a joyful one yet the permanent knowledge of his own nature in all living beings gives him a certain evenness and even serenity of disposition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1908.mp3	for the interest which is extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety as that which is concentrated upon one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1909.mp3	the accidents which concern individuals collectively equalise themselves while those which happen to the particular individual constitute good or bad fortune
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1910.mp3	thus though others have set up moral principles which they give out as prescriptions for virtue and laws which it was necessary to follow i as has already been said cannot do this because i have no ought or law to prescribe to the eternally free will
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1911.mp3	further than this it cannot go for there exists no reason for preferring the individuality of another to its own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1912.mp3	yet the number of other individuals whose whole happiness or life is in danger may outweigh the regard for one's own particular well being
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1913.mp3	so died socrates and giordano bruno and so many a hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hands of the priests
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1914.mp3	weeping is accordingly sympathy with our own selves or sympathy directed back on its source
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1915.mp3	it is therefore conditional upon the capacity for love and sympathy and also upon imagination
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1916.mp3	when we are moved to tears not through our own suffering but through that of another this happens as follows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1917.mp3	either we vividly put ourselves in the place of the sufferer by imagination or see in his fate the lot of humanity as a whole and consequently first of all our own lot and thus in a very roundabout way it is yet always about ourselves that we weep sympathy with ourselves which we feel this seems to be the principal reason of the universal and thus natural weeping in the case of death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1918.mp3	first of all he certainly weeps for the fate of the dead but he also weeps when after long heavy and incurable suffering death was to this man a wished for deliverance

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1924.mp3	as they came to the city a mist fell and jason and his comrades with the sons of phrixus went through the city without being seen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1925.mp3	the mist lifted and before the heroes was the wonder of the palace in the bright light of the morning
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1926.mp3	on each side of the courtyard were the palace buildings in one king a eetes lived with apsyrtus his son and in the other chalciope and medea lived with their handmaidens
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1927.mp3	and then a dove flew toward her it was being chased by a hawk and medea saw the hawk's eyes and beak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1928.mp3	we pulled away from that place and thereafter we were driven by the winds back to the mouth of the phasis
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1929.mp3	with him there came the mightiest of the heroes of greece
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1930.mp3	already he has heard of your bitter foes the sauromatae
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1931.mp3	he with his comrades would subdue them for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1932.mp3	a eetes's heart was filled with wrath as he looked upon them and his eyes shone as a leopard's eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1933.mp3	and then speaking to the king in a quiet voice jason said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1934.mp3	his heart was divided as to whether he should summon his armed men and have them slain upon the spot or whether he should put them into danger by the trial he would make of them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1935.mp3	it may be that ye are truly of the seed of the immortals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1936.mp3	and it may be that i shall give you the golden fleece to bear away after i have made trial of you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1937.mp3	she entered softly and she stood away from her father and the four who were speaking with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1938.mp3	she had a dark face that was made very strange by her crown of golden hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1939.mp3	know that on the plain of ares yonder i have two fire breathing bulls with feet of brass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1940.mp3	then i sowed the furrows not with the seed that demeter gives but with teeth of a dragon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1941.mp3	if you can accomplish this that i accomplished in days gone by i shall submit to you and give you the golden fleece
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1942.mp3	but if you cannot accomplish what i once accomplished you shall go from my city empty handed for it is not right that a brave man should yield aught to one who cannot show himself as brave
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1943.mp3	then jason utterly confounded cast his eyes upon the ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1944.mp3	i will dare this contest monstrous as it is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1945.mp3	as he said this he saw the eyes of medea grow wide as with fear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1946.mp3	phrontis and melas went to where their mother was
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1947.mp3	and as a mortal apollo sought to earn his bread amongst men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1948.mp3	afterward people wondered at admetus's ever smiling face and ever radiant being
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1949.mp3	that was before admetus sailed on the argo with jason and the companions of the quest
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1950.mp3	thereafter admetus having the love of alcestis was even more happy than he had been before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1951.mp3	a radiant figure it was and admetus knew that this was apollo come to him again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1952.mp3	but apollo turned to admetus a face that was without joy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1953.mp3	what years of happiness have been mine o apollo through your friendship for me said admetus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1954.mp3	but still apollo stood before him with a face that was without joy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1955.mp3	he spoke and his voice was not that clear and vibrant voice that he had once in speaking to admetus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1956.mp3	admetus admetus he said it is for me to tell you that you may no more look on the blue sky nor walk upon the green earth
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1957.mp3	it is for me to tell you that the god of the underworld will have you come to him admetus admetus know that even now the god of the underworld is sending death for you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1958.mp3	if one will go willingly in thy place with death thou canst still live on go admetus
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1959.mp3	and then he came upon an ancient woman who sat upon stones in the courtyard grinding corn between two stones
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1960.mp3	there she was sitting as he had first known her with her eyes bleared and her knees shaking and with the dust of the courtyard and the husks of the corn in her matted hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1961.mp3	he went to her and spoke to her and he asked her to take the place of the king and go with death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1962.mp3	but when she heard the name of death horror came into the face of the ancient woman and she cried out that she would not let death come near her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1963.mp3	admetus took the man's shriveled hand and he asked him if he would not take the king's place and go with death that was coming for him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1964.mp3	then admetus went into the palace and into the chamber where his bed was and he lay down upon the bed and he lamented that he would have to go with death that was coming for him from the god of the underworld and he lamented that none of the wretched ones around the palace would take his place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1965.mp3	one should go in your place for you are the king and have many great affairs to attend to
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1966.mp3	now the footsteps seemed to stop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1967.mp3	it was not so terrible for him as before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1968.mp3	and the words he had spoken he would have taken back the words that had brought her consent to go with death in his place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1969.mp3	death would soon be here for her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1970.mp3	no not here for he would not have death come into the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1971.mp3	he lifted alcestis from the bed and he carried her from the palace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1972.mp3	no more speech came from her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1973.mp3	and as for admetus he went within the chamber and knelt beside the bed on which alcestis had lain and thought of his terrible loss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1974.mp3	to what god is that sacrifice due
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1975.mp3	and then heracles felt that another labor was before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1976.mp3	i have dragged up from the underworld he thought the hound that guards those whom death brings down into the realm of the god of the underworld
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1977.mp3	why should i not strive with death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1978.mp3	and what a noble thing it would be to bring back this faithful woman to her house and to her husband
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1979.mp3	he left the palace of admetus and he went to the temple of the gods
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1980.mp3	you are held by me death and you will not be let go unless you promise to go forth from this temple without bringing one with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1981.mp3	and death knowing that heracles could hold him there and that the business of the god of the underworld would be left undone if he were held promised that he would leave the temple without bringing one with him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1982.mp3	she was veiled and admetus could not see her features
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1983.mp3	here is a woman whom i am bringing back to her husband i won her from an enemy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1984.mp3	this i cannot do said admetus i have had pangs enough
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1985.mp3	then admetus raised the veil of the woman he had taken across the threshold of his house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1986.mp3	lelechka was a delightful child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1987.mp3	there was no other such child there never had been and there never would be
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1988.mp3	lelechka's mother serafima aleksandrovna was sure of that
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1989.mp3	lelechka's eyes were dark and large her cheeks were rosy her lips were made for kisses and for laughter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1990.mp3	but it was not these charms in lelechka that gave her mother the keenest joy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1991.mp3	she felt cold with her husband
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1992.mp3	he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold currents seemed to move in the air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1993.mp3	it even seemed to serafima aleksandrovna that she was in love with her future husband and this made her happy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1994.mp3	the bride was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat timid but very tactful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1995.mp3	he had connexions and his wife came of good influential people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1996.mp3	this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1997.mp3	after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sergey modestovich to suggest anything wrong to his wife
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1998.mp3	later however when his wife was about to have a child sergey modestovich established connexions elsewhere of a light and temporary nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/1999.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna found this out and to her own astonishment was not particularly hurt she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2000.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2001.mp3	lelechka then ran away stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2002.mp3	where is my baby girl the mother asked as she looked for lelechka and made believe that she did not see her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2003.mp3	then she came out a little farther and her mother as though she had only just caught sight of her seized her by her little shoulders and exclaimed joyously here she is my lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2004.mp3	her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2005.mp3	her mother went to hide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2006.mp3	lelechka turned away as though not to see but watched her mamochka stealthily all the time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2007.mp3	where's my mamochka asked lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2008.mp3	a smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2009.mp3	lelechka was getting nearer her mother's corner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2010.mp3	her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2011.mp3	lelechka suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2012.mp3	through the half closed doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2013.mp3	even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2014.mp3	he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by serafima aleksandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2015.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna dressed herself tastefully this too she did for lelechka with the same end in view
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2016.mp3	one thing sergey modestovich had not become reconciled to and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2017.mp3	it's just as i thought i knew that i'd find you here he said with a derisive and condescending smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2018.mp3	merely you see that the child should feel its own individuality he explained in answer to serafima aleksandrovna's puzzled glance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2019.mp3	she's still so little said serafima aleksandrovna
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2020.mp3	i don't insist it's your kingdom there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2021.mp3	i'll think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2022.mp3	then they began to talk of something else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2023.mp3	that the mistress does it well that's one thing but that the young lady does it that's bad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2024.mp3	why asked fedosya with curiosity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2025.mp3	this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2026.mp3	yes that's bad repeated agathya with conviction terribly bad well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2027.mp3	it's the truth i'm saying remember my words agathya went on with the same assurance and secrecy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2028.mp3	it's the surest sign
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2029.mp3	the old woman had invented this sign quite suddenly herself and she was evidently very proud of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2030.mp3	madam madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2031.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna gave a start
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2032.mp3	fedosya's face made her anxious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2033.mp3	what is it fedosya she asked with great concern is there anything wrong with lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2034.mp3	no madam said fedosya as she gesticulated with her hands to reassure her mistress and to make her sit down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2035.mp3	lelechka is asleep may god be with her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2036.mp3	only i'd like to say something you see lelechka is always hiding herself that's not good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2037.mp3	i can't tell you how bad it is said fedosya and her face expressed the most decided confidence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2038.mp3	i understand nothing of what you are saying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2039.mp3	you see madam it's a kind of omen explained fedosya abruptly in a shamefaced way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2040.mp3	nonsense said serafima aleksandrovna
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2041.mp3	who told you all this asked serafima aleksandrovna in an austere low voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2042.mp3	knows exclaimed serafima aleksandrovna in irritation as though she wished to protect herself somehow from this sudden anxiety
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2043.mp3	what nonsense as though lelechka could die
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2044.mp3	she saw clearly that there could be no possible connexion between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2045.mp3	she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that lelechka loved to hide herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2046.mp3	when lelechka was still quite small and had learned to distinguish between her mother and her nurse she sometimes sitting in her nurse's arms made a sudden roguish grimace and hid her laughing face in the nurse's shoulder
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2047.mp3	then she would look out with a sly glance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2048.mp3	though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of lelechka's favourite game and she tried to divert lelechka's attention to something else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2049.mp3	she eagerly complied with her mother's new wishes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2050.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna tried desperately to amuse lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2051.mp3	perhaps thought serafima aleksandrovna she is not as strongly drawn to the world as other children who are attracted by many things
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2052.mp3	if this is so is it not a sign of organic weakness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2053.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2054.mp3	she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2055.mp3	it was a sad day for serafima aleksandrovna
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2056.mp3	her mother covered her with a blue blanket
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2057.mp3	lelechka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out to embrace her mother her mother bent down
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2058.mp3	she seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2059.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna remained standing over lelechka's bed a long while and she kept looking at lelechka with tenderness and fear
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2060.mp3	i'm a mother is it possible that i shouldn't be able to protect her she thought as she imagined the various ills that might befall lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2061.mp3	she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2062.mp3	several days passed lelechka caught cold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2063.mp3	the fever came upon her at night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2064.mp3	when serafima aleksandrovna awakened by fedosya came to lelechka and saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless despair took possession of her from the first moments
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2065.mp3	a doctor was called and everything was done that is usual on such occasions but the inevitable happened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2066.mp3	and lelechka grew feebler from hour to hour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2067.mp3	nothing made her so unhappy as the reiterations of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2068.mp3	fever was consuming lelechka and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2069.mp3	three days passed torturing like a nightmare
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2070.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near lelechka's bed how tragic
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2071.mp3	a white mamochka whispered lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2072.mp3	mamochka's white face became blurred and everything grew dark before lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2073.mp3	she met her husband
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2074.mp3	serafima aicksandrovna was standing by the coffin and looking dully at her dead child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2075.mp3	sima my dear don't agitate yourself said sergey modestovich in a whisper
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2076.mp3	you must resign yourself to your fate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2077.mp3	she'll be up in a minute persisted serafima aleksandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2078.mp3	sergey modestovich looked round him cautiously he was afraid of the unseemly and of the ridiculous
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2079.mp3	sima don't agitate yourself he repeated
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2080.mp3	he was confused and annoyed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2081.mp3	her face seemed tranquil and her eyes were dry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2082.mp3	she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where lelechka used to hide herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2083.mp3	she walked all about the room and bent now and then to look under the table or under the bed and kept on repeating cheerfully where is my little one where is my lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2084.mp3	after she had walked round the room once she began to make her quest anew
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2085.mp3	fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress then she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2086.mp3	she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka our angelic little soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2087.mp3	when she entered the parlour there were several people between her and lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2088.mp3	there was an oppressive feeling of heaviness in serafima aleksandrovna's head as she approached lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2089.mp3	lelechka lay there still and pale and smiled pathetically
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2090.mp3	the little one did not reply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2091.mp3	serafima aleksandrovna stood up erect sighed in a lost way smiled and called loudly lelechka
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2092.mp3	lelechka was being carried out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2093.mp3	the next day everybody in the house began to make preparations for the journey
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2094.mp3	everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking and disputing and the giving of contrary orders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2095.mp3	the old porter was there directing and scolding the servants as they piled the rugs and blankets and bags of food and pots and pans and dishes into the wagon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2096.mp3	there was quite a procession when at last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2097.mp3	behind it came the grandmother in her dhoolie dak a sort of a litter or easy chair swung between two long poles
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2098.mp3	besides the family there were many servants and several others walked beside the slow moving wagon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2099.mp3	the cook too went with them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2100.mp3	good bye shouted little nao from his garden wall as they went by good bye
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2101.mp3	they shouted greetings to their friend the potter as they passed him and also to the old fakir smeared all over with ashes who sat in a little brick hut by the bridge and pretended to make wonderful cures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2102.mp3	this is more fun than going to school said chola as the oxen plodded along through clouds of dust
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2103.mp3	these lovely birds are found nearly everywhere in india and in some parts run quite wild
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2104.mp3	his long matted hair hung on his shoulders and he was saying his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2105.mp3	as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bowl saying give oh charitable people to this holy one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2106.mp3	no country in the world has so many beggars as india
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2107.mp3	many of them are called holy men because they do nothing but make pilgrimages from one sacred place to another living solely on the alms that are given to them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2108.mp3	when they had eaten their lunch the young people went to explore the garden near them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2109.mp3	perhaps there are dogs said mahala a little fearfully but they forgot about dogs when they saw a thicket of sugar cane down by a stream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2110.mp3	perhaps we can buy some from the man there he is now ploughing by the stream said chola
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2111.mp3	it is looking for water said the farmer as he took a long stalk of cane and gently guided it down to the stream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2112.mp3	the snake is another sacred animal of the hindus and they would not kill or injure one for anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2113.mp3	as they were about to move on again they saw a great cloud of dust down the road
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2114.mp3	it turned out that it was a great and powerful rajah going in state on a journey to visit another rajah or ruler of one of the small kingdoms or states of which modern india was formerly made up
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2115.mp3	first there came a big elephant all decorated with silk and gold and silver
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2116.mp3	on the elephant's back was a howdah which is like a big chair with a canopy over it and in this sitting cross legged was the rajah a big fat fellow dressed in coloured silks and jewels with a great diamond set plume in his turban
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2117.mp3	behind the howdah stood a servant holding a big umbrella of fine feathers over the rajah's head
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2118.mp3	the driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast by prodding him on one side or the other with an iron shod stick or goad
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2119.mp3	isn't it fine to ride like that on a big elephant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2120.mp3	and all the rest of the day the little folk talked of nothing but the great rajah and his escort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2121.mp3	our party came to a halt among many other bullock carts the owners of which were already sitting around on the ground cooking their suppers or bargaining for food at the little booths
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2122.mp3	these they used for plates heaping them up with their boiled rice and curry and fish and all sorts of puddings and sweets
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2123.mp3	as supper was being eaten another party stopped at the parao and camped not far away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2124.mp3	when the litter was put down a young boy stepped out looking very proud and haughty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2125.mp3	his servants at once spread a handsome rug on the ground for him to sit on and rushed about waiting on him taking good care to keep every one at a distance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2126.mp3	yes and how he orders every one about him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2127.mp3	around the little brahmin's neck was a thin cord or thread which was the sign of his high caste
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2128.mp3	meanwhile the haughty little brahmin ate his supper with his head turned away so no one could see him eat and then growing tired of respectful glances of the crowd around him he got into his litter again and the servants fastened the curtains tightly around him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2129.mp3	everybody slept soundly in spite of the fact that one of the servants was beating a drum most of the night which they really believed was the way to keep off evil spirits
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2130.mp3	oh the thieves he cried
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2131.mp3	they are as bad as the beggars
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2132.mp3	what art thou guarding so carefully shriya asked her brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2133.mp3	he and chola were walking beside the wagon for a change
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2134.mp3	the lattices were raised so shriya and her mother and aunt could enjoy the fresh air
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2135.mp3	they are my dolls said the little girl sadly as she patted the bundle beside her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2136.mp3	i take them as an offering to the holy river poor little woman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2137.mp3	must thou sacrifice thy toys too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2138.mp3	smiled her uncle as he patted her head

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2140.mp3	the days glided by with the stiffness in chris lee's limbs growing less painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountain air seemed to act like a cure for wounds

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2156.mp3	well they showed themselves to me i didn't want them said griggs dryly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2157.mp3	they're an artful lot never been away at all i believe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2158.mp3	we couldn't see em but if we'd made a start they'd have been close upon our heels directly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2159.mp3	ah you'll have to trap them chris said ned maliciously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2160.mp3	look here if you say that again we shall quarrel hear that griggs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2161.mp3	oh yes i hear serve you right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2162.mp3	if you can't show us a better way you had better hold your tongue
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2163.mp3	very well i can do that said ned haughtily
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2164.mp3	there that's enough cried chris don't be so petty ned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2165.mp3	that's right cried griggs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2166.mp3	look here lads i've just been trying that place again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2167.mp3	any time the doctor likes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2168.mp3	being shot at by fellows with bows and arrows sounds bad enough but there's not much risk here
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2169.mp3	i don't know about that said chris anxiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2170.mp3	don't you well i do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2171.mp3	i should be running fast and dodging in and out among the rocks and trees
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2172.mp3	but the enemy won't be standing still continued griggs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2173.mp3	i don't believe there's a bit of risk for me i shall be all right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2174.mp3	but our animals will be well back in that hollow said chris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2175.mp3	yes my lad but i want them to be planted farther back still
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2176.mp3	i'm afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at hand
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2177.mp3	yes that's right if it can be done but it would go hard with us all if the indians gave up the bait of the trap and turned upon those who set it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2178.mp3	well you must talk it over with father said chris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2179.mp3	too many redskins about as i told you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2180.mp3	there are always too many redskins about cried chris impatiently
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2181.mp3	i wish we could charge them boldly and send them flying over the plains
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2182.mp3	never to come back again said ned sharply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2183.mp3	not quite my lads don't you see that we're playing a very ticklish game
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2184.mp3	just then the doctor came into the shelter where the boys had been talking bringing with him wilton who had been shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they too were talking earnestly about ways and means
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2185.mp3	oh here you are griggs cried the doctor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2186.mp3	had a good turn at scouting yes sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2187.mp3	the indians have shifted their quarters and they're in about as awkward a position as they could contrive for our purpose
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2188.mp3	we must get away from here to some good hunting ground
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2189.mp3	do the indians seem to be camping or only on the move
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2190.mp3	they seem to me to be hatching up some dodge or another replied griggs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2191.mp3	then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deep in thought
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2192.mp3	there he said i've made up my mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2193.mp3	it is very evident that we may wait here till our stores are exhausted and be as far off the opportunity we seek as ever
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2194.mp3	the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2195.mp3	going to give up young chris's plan said griggs slowly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2196.mp3	no i'm going to put it in force at once we start to night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2197.mp3	but all the same we can be making our preparations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2198.mp3	the barrels can be filled with water and every one's bottle
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2199.mp3	provisions can be packed in our wallets in fact everything held ready for a start
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2200.mp3	finally just at dusk the animals can be driven in for food and water and
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2201.mp3	exactly replied the doctor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2202.mp3	but before any more is said griggs i want to offer you the opportunity to draw back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2203.mp3	what for said griggs sharply
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2204.mp3	not a bit of it sir i'm going to take care they don't hit me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2205.mp3	i mean to do a bit to carry out young chris's plan and shut up the redskins for a week or two perhaps a month while we get right away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2206.mp3	there is a horrible side to it griggs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2207.mp3	would be if we let them get the better of us sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2208.mp3	you mean the shutting up the enemy here to starve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2209.mp3	ejaculated griggs so sharply that the boys started serve em right if they did sir
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2210.mp3	what business have they to want our scalps but we shouldn't shut them up to starve
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2211.mp3	they'd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out in a week
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2212.mp3	starve nonsense
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2213.mp3	but there i don't want to make speeches it's all settled gentlemen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2214.mp3	but you've got to tell the lookout what's coming off
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2215.mp3	now every one understands that he is to be ready without showing any watchful indian scout that there is something on the way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2216.mp3	i see shoals of them depart not perhaps without an innate longing too to quit the island along with those happy snobs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2217.mp3	farewell dear friends i say you little know that the individual who regards you from the beach is your friend and historiographer and brother
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2218.mp3	i went to day to see our excellent friend snooks on board the queen of the french many scores of snobs were there on the deck of that fine ship marching forth in their pride and bravery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2219.mp3	they will be at ostend in four hours they will inundate the continent next week they will carry into far lands the famous image of the british snob
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2220.mp3	i have seen snobs in pink coats and hunting boots scouring over the campagna of rome and have heard their oaths and their well known slang in the galleries of the vatican and under the shadowy arches of the colosseum
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2221.mp3	my lady marchioness comes on board looks round with that happy air of mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship and rushes to her carriage for it is impossible that she should mingle with the other snobs on deck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2222.mp3	there she sits and will be ill in private
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2223.mp3	the strawberry leaves on her chariot panels are engraved on her ladyship's heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2224.mp3	and davis you'd best take the pistol case into the cabin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2225.mp3	look at honest nathan houndsditch and his lady and their little son
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2226.mp3	what a noble air of blazing contentment illuminates the features of those snobs of eastern race
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2227.mp3	what a toilette houndsditch's is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2228.mp3	he will never spare himself any cheap enjoyment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2229.mp3	i have said before i like to look at the peoples on their gala days they are so picturesquely and outrageously splendid and happy
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2230.mp3	yonder comes captain bull spick and span tight and trim who travels for four or six months every year of his life who does not commit himself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour but i think is as great a snob as any man on board
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2231.mp3	bull passes the season in london sponging for dinners and sleeping in a garret near his club
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2232.mp3	see he is up to old carabas already i told you he would
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2233.mp3	that broad shouldered buck with the great whiskers and the cleaned white kid gloves is mister phelim clancy of poldoodystown he calls himself mister de clancy he endeavours to disguise his native brogue with the richest superposition of english and if you play at billiards or ecarte with him the chances are that you will win the first game and he the seven or eight games ensuing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2234.mp3	the next person is but hark
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2235.mp3	pray captain quoth i as i was going down into the cabin is a man never overtaken by death in this passage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2236.mp3	why there is not time for a man to be sick in it replied he what a cursed lyar for i am sick as a horse quoth i already what a brain upside down hey day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2237.mp3	sick sick

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2239.mp3	when shall we get to land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2240.mp3	the wind chopp'd about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2241.mp3	s'death then i shall meet him full in the face
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2242.mp3	captain quoth she for heaven's sake let us get ashore
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2243.mp3	was not democritus who laughed ten times more than i town clerk of abdera
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2244.mp3	nay if you don't believe me you may read the chapter for your pains
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2245.mp3	when a gross instance of snobbishness happens why should not the indignant journalist call the public attention to that delinquency too
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2246.mp3	how for instance could that wonderful case of the earl of mangelwurzel and his brother be examined in the snobbish point of view
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2247.mp3	all we require is that a man should be recommended to us by the earl of mangelwurzelshire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2248.mp3	o you pride of all snobland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2249.mp3	o you crawling truckling self confessed lackeys and parasites
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2250.mp3	it was her snobbish sentiment that misled her and made her vanities a prey to the swindling fortune teller
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2251.mp3	how would you account for the prodigious benevolence exercised towards the interesting young french lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2252.mp3	the honest boarding house people were at her feet at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2253.mp3	good honest simple lord loving children of snobland
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2254.mp3	finally there was the case of the right honourable mister vernon at york
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2255.mp3	the right honourable was the son of a nobleman and practised on an old lady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2256.mp3	then he cast his nets over a family of father mother and daughters one of whom he proposed to marry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2257.mp3	one day the traitor fled with a teapot and a basketful of cold victuals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2258.mp3	it was the right honourable which baited the hook which gorged all these greedy simple snobs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2259.mp3	would they have been taken in by a commoner
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2260.mp3	alas and alas what mortal man that speaks the truth can hope for such a landlady
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2261.mp3	and yet all these instances of fond and credulous snobbishness have occurred in the same week's paper with who knows how many score more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2262.mp3	we are three sisters from seventeen to twenty two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2263.mp3	we are just the same to persons with a handle to their name as to those without it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2264.mp3	if you do i cannot help it but i am of a sanguine disposition and entertain a lingering hope
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2265.mp3	excuse this scrawl but i always write headlong
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2266.mp3	we never write on perfumed paper in short i can't help thinking that if you knew us you would not think us snobs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2267.mp3	i shall have a black crape round my white hat and my usual bamboo cane with the richly gilt knob
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2268.mp3	i am sorry there will be no time to get up moustaches between now and next week
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2269.mp3	from seventeen to two and twenty ye gods what ages
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2270.mp3	dear young creatures i can see you all three
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2271.mp3	seventeen suits me as nearest my own time of life but mind i don't say two and twenty is too old
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2272.mp3	no no and that pretty roguish demure middle one
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2273.mp3	peace peace thou silly little fluttering heart
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2274.mp3	you snobs dear young ladies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2275.mp3	i will pull any man's nose who says so
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2276.mp3	there is no harm in being of a good family
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2277.mp3	you can't help it poor dears what's in a name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2278.mp3	that very confidence savours of arrogance and to be arrogant is to be a snob
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2279.mp3	but are there no kindly natures no tender hearts no souls humble simple and truth loving
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2280.mp3	ponder well on this question sweet young ladies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2281.mp3	interest however still runs on in both cases the periodical or accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hour pop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2282.mp3	as the reader for i hate your ifs has a thorough knowledge of human nature i need not say more to satisfy him that my hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2283.mp3	to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding eugenius's frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted thro any malignancy but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humour they would all of them be cross'd out in course
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2284.mp3	eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to the uttermost mite
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2285.mp3	what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2286.mp3	yorick followed eugenius with his eyes to the door he then closed them and never opened them more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2287.mp3	alas poor yorick
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2288.mp3	i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctors orders
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2289.mp3	that old man ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2290.mp3	felice had given them orders not to speak to me of this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2291.mp3	this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would have been very glad if i had died
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2292.mp3	accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full one i then covered myself and began to sweat and fell into a deep sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2293.mp3	they say that my poor friend was on the point of falling to the ground so grieved was he to hear this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2294.mp3	afterwards he took an ugly stick and began to beat the serving girl with all his might shouting out ah traitress you have killed him for me then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2295.mp3	she may indeed have saved my life so lend me a helping hand for i have sweated and be quick about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2296.mp3	felice recovered his spirits dried and made me comfortable and i being conscious of a great improvement in my state began to reckon on recovery
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2297.mp3	just then the other doctor bernardino put in his appearance who at the beginning of my illness had refused to bleed me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2298.mp3	maestro francesco that most able man exclaimed oh power of nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2299.mp3	she knows what she requires and the physicians know nothing
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2300.mp3	that simpleton maestro bernardino made answer saying if he had drunk another bottle he would have been cured upon the spot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2301.mp3	afterwards he turned to me and asked if i could have drunk more water
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2302.mp3	i answered no because i had entirely quenched my thirst
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2303.mp3	in like manner she was asking for what she wanted when the poor young man begged you to bleed him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2304.mp3	if you knew that his recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2305.mp3	you might then have boasted of his cure
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2306.mp3	at these words the wretched quack sulkily departed and never showed his face again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2307.mp3	the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2308.mp3	do not permit him any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2309.mp3	then he turned to me and said my benvenuto be prudent commit no excesses and when you are quite recovered i beg you to make me a madonna with your own hand and i will always pay my devotions to it for your sake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2310.mp3	so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2311.mp3	that day many friends came to see me among others pier landi who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2312.mp3	next day there came a certain niccolo da monte aguto who was also a very great friend of mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2313.mp3	i had harboured him in rome and provided for his costs while he had turned my whole house upside down for the man was subject to a species of dry scab which he was always in the habit of scratching with his hands
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2314.mp3	meanwhile that able physician francesco da monte varchi attended to my cure with great skill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2315.mp3	there they seated me to wait until the duke went by
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2316.mp3	many of my friends at court came up to greet me and expressed surprise that i had undergone the inconvenience of being carried in that way while so shattered by illness they said that i ought to have waited till i was well and then to have visited the duke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2317.mp3	at these words maestro agostino the dukes tailor made his way through all those gentlemen and said if that is all you want to know you shall know it at this very moment
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2318.mp3	giorgio the painter whom i have mentioned happened just then to pass and maestro agostino exclaimed there is the man who accused you now you know yourself if it be true or not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2319.mp3	as fiercely as i could not being able to leave my seat i asked giorgio if it was true that he had accused me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2320.mp3	he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2321.mp3	maestro agostino retorted you gallows bird
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2322.mp3	dont you know that i know it for most certain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2323.mp3	giorgio made off as quickly as he could repeating that he had not accused me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2324.mp3	then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2325.mp3	the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2326.mp3	when i reached home niccolo da monte aguto came to visit me and told me that i had escaped one of the most dreadful perils in the world quite contrary to all his expectations for he had seen my ruin written with indelible ink now i must make haste to get well and afterwards take french leave because my jeopardy came from a quarter and a man who was able to destroy me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2327.mp3	i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair about the mint
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2328.mp3	he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2329.mp3	i the best attention to my health gave pietro pagolo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2330.mp3	you want them to immortalise that ferocious tyrant
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2331.mp3	you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2332.mp3	it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2333.mp3	messer francesco used also to say and swear by all his saints that if he could he would have robbed me of the dies for that medal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2334.mp3	i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2335.mp3	i now sent to florence to request lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2336.mp3	niccolo da monte aguto to whom i had written wrote back saying that he had spoken to that mad melancholy philosopher lorenzino for it he had replied that he was thinking night and day of nothing else and that he would finish it as soon as he was able
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2337.mp3	nevertheless i was not to set my hopes upon his reverse but i had better invent one out of my own head and when i had finished it i might bring it without hesitation to the duke for this would be to my advantage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2338.mp3	i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the work forward to my best ability
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2339.mp3	this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2340.mp3	i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling piece ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2341.mp3	i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2342.mp3	i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2343.mp3	the fawn had taken his morning meal and now lay curled up on a bed of moss
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2344.mp3	whenever the fawn caught up he was quite content to frisk about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2345.mp3	the danger was certain now it was near
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2346.mp3	the hounds had struck her trail where she turned and the fawn was safe
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2347.mp3	one was rowing the other had a gun in his hand what should she do
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2348.mp3	her tired legs could not propel the tired body rapidly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2349.mp3	the doe saw the boat nearing her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2350.mp3	in a moment more the boat was on her and the man at the oars had leaned over and caught her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2351.mp3	he is not by temperament a singer
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2352.mp3	his music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2353.mp3	truth to tell mister hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2354.mp3	he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2355.mp3	thus he writes in i found her out there of one who
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2356.mp3	there could not be an uglier and more prosaic exaggeration than is contained in the image in the last line
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2357.mp3	and prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2358.mp3	take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same poem about
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2359.mp3	when we as strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2360.mp3	catering care is an appalling phrase
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2361.mp3	is a line of good poetry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2362.mp3	you did not come and marching time drew on and wore me numb yet less for loss of your dear presence there than that i thus found lacking in your make that high compassion which can overbear reluctance for pure loving kindness sake grieved i when as the hope hour stroked its sum you did not come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2363.mp3	there are hints of the grand style of lyric poetry in these lines but phrases like in your make and as the hope hour stroked its sum are discords that bring it tumbling to the levels of victorian commonplace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2364.mp3	he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2365.mp3	one can remember poem after poem of his with a theme that might easily have served for mister hardy too late cristina the lost mistress the last ride together the statue and the bust to name a few
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2366.mp3	but what a sense of triumph there is in browning's tragedies
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2367.mp3	his world is a place of opulence not of poverty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2368.mp3	to have loved even for an hour is with browning to live for ever after in the inheritance of a mighty achievement
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2369.mp3	to have loved for an hour is in mister hardy's imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2370.mp3	for then i undistrest by hearts grown cold to me could lonely wait my endless rest with equanimity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2371.mp3	but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eve with throbbings of noontide
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2372.mp3	and despair is by no means triumphant in what is perhaps the most attractive of all mister hardy's poems the oxen
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2373.mp3	we pictured the meek mild creatures where they dwelt in their strawy pen nor did it occur to one of us there to doubt they were kneeling then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2374.mp3	the mood of faith however or rather of delight in the memory of faith is not mister hardy's prevailing mood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2375.mp3	he can enter upon a war without ironical doubts as we see in the song men who march away
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2376.mp3	how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2377.mp3	when shall the saner softer polities whereof we dream have sway in each proud land and patriotism grown godlike scorn to stand bondslave to realms but circle earth and seas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2378.mp3	but perhaps his characteristic attitude to war is to be found not in lines like these but in that melancholy poem the souls of the slain in which the souls of the dead soldiers return to their country and question a senior soul flame as to how their friends and relatives have kept their doughty deeds in remembrance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2379.mp3	and general how hold out our sweethearts sworn loyal as doves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2380.mp3	some fickle and fleet hearts have found them new loves
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2381.mp3	and our wives quoth another resignedly dwell they on our deeds
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2382.mp3	mister hardy has too bitter a sense of reality to believe much in the glory of war
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2383.mp3	the real world to mister hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2384.mp3	it may be thought on the other hand that mister hardy's poems about war are no more expressive of tragic futility than his poems about love
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2385.mp3	futility and frustration are ever recurring themes in both
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2386.mp3	his lovers like his soldiers rot in the grave defeated of their glory
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2387.mp3	lovers are always severed both in life and in death
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2388.mp3	in beyond the last lamp we have the same mournful cry over severance
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2389.mp3	no shade of pinnacle or tree or tower while earth endures will fall on my mound and within the hour steal on to yours one robin never haunt our two green covertures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2390.mp3	they bring us face to face with an experience intenser than our own
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2391.mp3	nothing of tiniest worth have i wrought pondered planned no one thing asking blame or praise since the pale corpse like birth of this diurnal unit bearing blanks in all its rays dullest of dull hued days
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2392.mp3	his characters get drunk or go mad with jealousy or fall in epileptic fits or rave hysterically
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2393.mp3	if dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been strindberg
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2394.mp3	like them he is a novelist of torture
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2395.mp3	certainly the lust of cruelty the lust of destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dostoevsky's men and women
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2396.mp3	he may not be a cruel author
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2397.mp3	but they are never in balance they are always in demoniacal conflict
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2398.mp3	even the lust is never or hardly ever the lust of a more or less sane man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2399.mp3	dostoevsky could not have described the sin of nekhludov in resurrection
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2400.mp3	this is a madhouse cries some one in the idiot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2401.mp3	one result of this is a multiplicity of action
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2402.mp3	even the talk is of actions more than of ideas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2403.mp3	he sows violent deeds not with the hand but with the sack
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2404.mp3	but one had noticed during those last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on him before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2405.mp3	he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for christ's sake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2406.mp3	he never paints everyman he always projects dostoevsky or a nightmare of dostoevsky
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2407.mp3	that is why crime and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than anna karenina or fathers and sons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2408.mp3	we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2409.mp3	he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity and passion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2410.mp3	one does not grudge an artist an abnormal character or two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2411.mp3	he invents vicious grotesques as dickens invents comic grotesques
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2412.mp3	was very fond of hanging cats and burying them with great ceremony
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2413.mp3	as for the karamazovs themselves he portrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2414.mp3	serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2415.mp3	if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2416.mp3	it is easy to see why dostoevsky has become a popular author
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2417.mp3	no melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2418.mp3	dostoevsky is always ready to show them all in at once
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2419.mp3	on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general epanchin prince s adelaida ivanovna lizaveta prokofyevna yevgeny pavlovitch radomsky princess byelokonsky aglaia prince myshkin kolya ivolgin ippolit varya ferdyshchenko nastasya filippovna nina alexandrovna ganya ptitsyn and general ivolgin
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2420.mp3	but the secret of dostoevsky's appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2421.mp3	mister murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2422.mp3	to him dostoevsky's work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of struggle it is the struggle itself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2423.mp3	and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern set in surrounding darkness
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2424.mp3	ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2425.mp3	because they are possessed they are no longer men and women
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2426.mp3	this is all in a measure true
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2427.mp3	to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dostoevsky's work the anguish of the imprisoned soul as it battles with doubt and denial and despair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2428.mp3	there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than setebos
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2429.mp3	the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peter's lord i believe help thou mine unbelief
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2430.mp3	and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night dostoevsky still sees the light of christian compassion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2431.mp3	or even by the compassion of others like prince myshkin in the idiot
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2432.mp3	his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2433.mp3	the novels are the perfect image of the man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2434.mp3	as to the man himself the vicomte de voguee described him as he saw him in the last years of his life
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2435.mp3	when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated on a bench in a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2436.mp3	at all other times he carried that look of sad and gentle meekness seen on the images of old slavonic saints
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2437.mp3	that is the portrait of the man one sees behind dostoevsky's novels a portrait one might almost have inferred from the novels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2438.mp3	it is a figure that at once fascinates and repels
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2439.mp3	the pavlograds held feast after feast celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to olmutz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2440.mp3	the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2441.mp3	the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand duke's orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their proper posts
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2442.mp3	boris had been quartered and had marched all the way with berg who was already in command of a company
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2443.mp3	boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainted with prince andrew bolkonski through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief's staff
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2444.mp3	berg and boris having rested after yesterday's march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2445.mp3	well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2446.mp3	at that moment the door opened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2447.mp3	dear me how you have changed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2448.mp3	he was about to embrace his friend but nicholas avoided him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2449.mp3	he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2450.mp3	but notwithstanding this boris embraced him in a quiet friendly way and kissed him three times
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2451.mp3	they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young men take their first steps on life's road each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2452.mp3	i did not expect you today he added

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2455.mp3	what dinners and balls i can't tell you

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2457.mp3	he went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sent for wine

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2459.mp3	oh don't mention it count i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2460.mp3	go across to our hosts they invited you added boris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2461.mp3	berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having assured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2462.mp3	oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read the letter why
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2463.mp3	well have you sent gabriel for some wine all right let's have some
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2464.mp3	in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess at anna mikhaylovna's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2465.mp3	why have you thrown that away asked boris
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2466.mp3	it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2467.mp3	he looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2468.mp3	would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i was right
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2469.mp3	i came forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his did
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2470.mp3	well he stormed at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2471.mp3	it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2472.mp3	albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2473.mp3	still i remained silent and what do you think count
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2474.mp3	the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2475.mp3	that's the way count said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2476.mp3	yes that was fine said rostov smiling
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2477.mp3	rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2478.mp3	he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2479.mp3	prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2480.mp3	in spite of prince andrew's disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silent
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2481.mp3	boris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2482.mp3	we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2483.mp3	berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2484.mp3	i was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the aide de camp
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2485.mp3	with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now told about that affair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2486.mp3	but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2487.mp3	our stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2488.mp3	however he added rising you know my name and where to find me but don't forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2489.mp3	exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them both he went out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2490.mp3	and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2491.mp3	he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode home
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2492.mp3	should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried him all the way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2493.mp3	it was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2494.mp3	not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's handwriting
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2495.mp3	on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the letter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2496.mp3	each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mikhaylovna the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2497.mp3	but for god's sake be careful you know how it may affect your mamma
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2498.mp3	no on my true word of honor said natasha crossing herself i won't tell anyone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2499.mp3	and she ran off at once to sonya
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2500.mp3	she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to cry

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2507.mp3	i remember nikolenka too i remember him well she said
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2508.mp3	no she shut her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2509.mp3	she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there was such love as sonya was speaking of
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2510.mp3	she believed it could be but did not understand it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2511.mp3	shall you write to him she asked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2512.mp3	now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2514.mp3	sonya smiled no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2515.mp3	it's because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles that was how petya described his namesake the new count bezukhov and now she's in love with that singer he meant natasha's italian singing master that's why she's ashamed
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2516.mp3	petya you're a stupid said natasha

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2518.mp3	on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears kept coming into her eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2519.mp3	the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2520.mp3	at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna mikhaylovna's voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2522.mp3	when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2523.mp3	the countess was crying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2524.mp3	from all he says one should be glad and not cry

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2598.mp3	now when christian got as far as the spring of life he drank of it and then went up the hill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2599.mp3	now half way up was a cave made by the lord of that hill that those who came by might rest there
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2600.mp3	timorous said that zion was the hill they meant to climb but that when they had got half way they found that they met with more and more risk so that great fear came on them and all they could do was to turn back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2601.mp3	yes said mistrust for just in front of us there lay two beasts of prey in our path we knew not if they slept or not but we thought that they would fall on us and tear our limbs
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2602.mp3	yet he thought once more of what he had heard from the men and then he felt in his cloak for his scroll that he might read it and find some peace
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2603.mp3	he felt for it but found it not
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2604.mp3	so he fell down on his knees to pray that god would give him grace for this act and then went back to look for his scroll
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2605.mp3	oh fool that i am said he to sleep in the day time so to give way to the flesh as to use for ease that rest which the lord of the hill had made but for the help of the soul
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2606.mp3	such was the lot of the jews for their sin they were sent back by the way of the red sea and i am made to tread those steps with grief which i might have trod with joy had it not been for this sleep
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2607.mp3	how far might i have been on my way by this time
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2608.mp3	now by this time he had come to the vale once more where for a spell he sat down and wept but at last as he cast a sad glance at the foot of the bench he saw his scroll which he caught up with haste and put in his cloak
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2609.mp3	words are too weak to tell the joy of christian when he had got back his scroll
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2610.mp3	he laid it up in the breast of his coat and gave thanks to god
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2611.mp3	with what a light step did he now climb the hill
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2612.mp3	ah thought he these beasts range in the night for their prey and if they should meet with me in the dark how should i fly from them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2613.mp3	the name of the man who kept the lodge of that house was watchful and when he saw that christian made a halt as if he would go back he came out to him and said is thy strength so small
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2614.mp3	fear not the two wild beasts for they are bound by chains and are put here to try the faith of those that have it and to find out those that have none
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2615.mp3	keep in the midst of the path and no harm shall come to thee
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2616.mp3	then i saw in my dream that still he went on in great dread of the wild beasts he heard them roar yet they did him no harm but when he had gone by them he went on with joy till he came and stood in front of the lodge where watchful dwelt
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2617.mp3	christian sir what house is this may i rest here to night
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2618.mp3	when watchful told her why christian had come there she said what is your name
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2619.mp3	then christian bent down his head and went with them to the house
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2620.mp3	piety come good christian since our love prompts us to take you in to rest let us talk with you of all that you have seen on your way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2621.mp3	christian with a right good will and i am glad that you should ask it of me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2622.mp3	prudence and first say what is it that makes you wish so much to go to mount zion
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2623.mp3	there they say is no death and there i shall dwell with such as love the lord
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2624.mp3	charity have you a wife and babes christian yes i have
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2625.mp3	charity and why did you not bring them with you
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2626.mp3	but they would not come with me nor have me leave them
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2627.mp3	thus did christian talk with these friends till it grew dark and then he took his rest in a large room the name of which was peace there he slept till break of day and then he sang a hymn
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2628.mp3	and they brought out the jaw bone of an ass with which samson did such great feats and the sling and stone with which david slew goliath of gath
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2629.mp3	what is the name of this land said christian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2630.mp3	then they told him it was immanuel's land
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2631.mp3	four whether in that state man would have been master over men
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2632.mp3	therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2633.mp3	therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2634.mp3	secondly this is proved by the order of divine providence which always governs inferior things by the superior
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2635.mp3	thirdly this is proved from a property of man and of other animals
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2636.mp3	now whatever is participated is subject to what is essential and universal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2637.mp3	therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2638.mp3	they would not however on this account have been excepted from the mastership of man as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained all this
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2639.mp3	this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2640.mp3	so all animals would have obeyed man of their own accord as in the present state some domestic animals obey him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2641.mp3	objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have had mastership over all other creatures
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2642.mp3	much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state of innocence
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2643.mp3	therefore since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over plants
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2644.mp3	now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2645.mp3	i answer that we must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2646.mp3	there might also have been bodily disparity
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2647.mp3	inequality might also arise on the part of nature as above described without any defect of nature
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2648.mp3	objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have been master over man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2649.mp3	therefore in the state of innocence man would not have been subject to man
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2650.mp3	in another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men can be called a master
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2651.mp3	such a kind of mastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and man for two reasons
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2652.mp3	but in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of old age
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2653.mp3	on the contrary everything generated is first imperfect but in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2654.mp3	therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2655.mp3	therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary nature's process in generation would have been in harmony with the manner in which it was established by god
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2656.mp3	more than this he hath been heard to rail on you my lord who are now his judge
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2657.mp3	judge thy just doom would be to die on the spot still let us hear what thou hast to say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2658.mp3	then the judge to sum up the case spoke thus you see this man who has made such a stir in our town
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2659.mp3	thus while one lost his life for the truth a new man rose from his death to tread the same way with christian
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2660.mp3	come good hopeful said christian let us walk on the grass
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2661.mp3	so they set off through the field
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2662.mp3	hopeful i had my fears from the first and so gave you a hint christian good friend i grieve that i have brought you out of the right path
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2663.mp3	hopeful say no more no doubt it is for our good
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2664.mp3	christian we must not stand thus let us try to go back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2665.mp3	then said giant despair you have no right to force your way in here the ground on which you lie is mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2666.mp3	they had not much to say as they knew that they were in fault
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2667.mp3	and by this act we kill our souls as well
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2668.mp3	his body was long and slender hard and agile his sight keen his aim unerring
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2669.mp3	in the month of agrahayan kanti had gone out shooting near the swamp of nydighi with a few sporting companions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2670.mp3	one morning as kanti was seated in his boat cleaning a favourite gun he suddenly started at what he thought was the cry of wild duck looking up he saw a village maiden coming to the water's edge with two white ducklings clasped to her breast
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2671.mp3	the girl put the birds into the water and watched them anxiously
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2672.mp3	looking round kanti saw one of his men pointing an unloaded gun at the ducks
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2673.mp3	kanti went on cleaning his gun
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2674.mp3	after kanti had eaten and drunk the brahmin begged him to introduce himself kanti gave his own name his father's name and the address of his home and then said in the usual way if i can be of any service sir i shall deem myself fortunate
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2675.mp3	so saying kanti repeated his salute and went back
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2676.mp3	the brick built mansion of the mazumdars had been borrowed for the wedding ceremony which was fixed for next magh as kanti did not wish to delay
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2677.mp3	in due time the bridegroom arrived on his elephant with drums and music and with a torchlight procession and the ceremony began
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2678.mp3	in that bashful downcast face crowned with the wedding coronet and bedecked with sandal paste he could scarcely recognise the village maiden of his fancy and in the fulness of his emotion a mist seemed to becloud his eyes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2679.mp3	the light of the lamps seemed to grow dim and darkness to tarnish the face of the bride herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2680.mp3	at first he felt angry with his father in law the old scoundrel had shown him one girl and married him to another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2681.mp3	close upon it followed the girl he had seen before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2682.mp3	oh the mad girl cried the women as they made signs to her to leave the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2683.mp3	all the women in the room began to titter
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2684.mp3	the increasing laughter in the room betokened an amusing joke
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2685.mp3	with a sigh of intense relief as of escape from calamity he looked once more into the face of his bride
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2686.mp3	peleg snuggers the general utility man of the hall had just brought the boys up from cedarville to which place they had journeyed from ithaca on the regular afternoon boat running up cayuga lake

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2732.mp3	one night when both were sleeping the prince had a remarkable dream
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2733.mp3	they rushed into the room added their cries to hers and forgetting all their former precautions left the doors open so that the guards outside hearing the clamour entered and saw the prince
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2734.mp3	she is a disgrace to her family and shall soon see her husband impaled on a stake
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2735.mp3	then with his forehead disfigured by a fearful frown he continued to abuse the prince and having tied his hands behind him dragged him from the room
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2736.mp3	treated thus like some wild beast roughly shaken and neglected rajavahana would have suffered greatly had he not been protected by the magic jewel given to him in patala and which he had contrived to conceal in his hair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2737.mp3	advancing therefore with a large army he prepared to besiege champa the capital city
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2738.mp3	a terrible battle ensued in which both kings performed prodigies of valour
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2739.mp3	should there be any pity for the violator of the harem
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2740.mp3	if the old king my father now in his dotage was foolish enough to favour the criminal for the sake of his worthless daughter you had no need of his permission and ought not to have been influenced by him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2741.mp3	let that vile seducer be immediately put to death by torture and his paramour be shut up in prison till i come
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2742.mp3	have ready also a fierce elephant suitably equipped which i shall mount immediately after the wedding to overtake my army in march against the enemy and as i set out i will make the elephant trample the life out of that criminal
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2743.mp3	while he stood there calmly awaiting death which now seemed inevitable he suddenly felt his feet free and a beautiful lady appeared before him
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2744.mp3	she humbly bowing down said let my lord pardon his servant for the injury which she has unconsciously caused
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2745.mp3	i am an apsaras born from the rays of the moon
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2746.mp3	one day as i was flying through the air wearing a white dress a swan mistaking me for a lotus flower attacked me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2747.mp3	in his anger he cursed me saying o wicked one for this offence you are condemned to be changed into a piece of unconscious metal

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2768.mp3	here was she disturbed and unhappy because her instinct had made anything but a refusal impossible while he not many minutes after he had met with a rejection of what ought to have been the deepest holiest proposal of his life could speak as if briefs success and all its superficial consequences of a good house clever and agreeable society were the sole avowed objects of his desires oh dear

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2772.mp3	margaret was preparing her mother's worsted work and rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bed time were come that she might go over the events of the day again

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2774.mp3	i want to speak to you about something very serious to us all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2775.mp3	very serious to us all
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2776.mp3	mister lennox had never had the opportunity of having any private conversation with her father after her refusal or else that would indeed be a very serious affair
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2777.mp3	but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts that her father wished to speak to her
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2778.mp3	mister hale did not answer for a minute or two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2779.mp3	margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense which was even more distressing to her father than to herself
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2780.mp3	but why dear papa do tell me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2781.mp3	because i must no longer be a minister in the church of england
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2782.mp3	but nothing to the shock she received from mister hale's last speech what could he mean
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2783.mp3	it was all the worse for being so mysterious
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2784.mp3	why can you no longer be a clergyman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2785.mp3	surely if the bishop were told all we know about frederick and the hard unjust
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2786.mp3	margaret i will tell you about it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2787.mp3	i will answer any questions this once but after to night let us never speak of it again
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2788.mp3	i can meet the consequences of my painful miserable doubts but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2789.mp3	no not doubts as to religion not the slightest injury to that he paused
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2790.mp3	margaret sighed as if standing on the verge of some new horror
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2791.mp3	margaret how i love the holy church from which i am to be shut out
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2792.mp3	he could not go on for a moment or two
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2793.mp3	margaret could not tell what to say it seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about to turn mahometan
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2794.mp3	the one staid foundation of her home of her idea of her beloved father seemed reeling and rocking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2795.mp3	he swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto and going to his bookcase he took down a volume which he had often been reading lately and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2796.mp3	listen dear margaret said he putting one arm round her waist
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2797.mp3	when god will not use thee in one kind yet he will in another
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2798.mp3	if when thou art charged with corrupting god's worship falsifying thy vows thou pretendest a necessity for it in order to a continuance in the ministry
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2799.mp3	as he read this and glanced at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margaret's low convulsive sob and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2800.mp3	i have borne long with self reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2801.mp3	he shook his head as he went on
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2802.mp3	margaret i tried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment and stopping quietly here strangling my conscience now as i had strained it before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2803.mp3	god forgive me
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2804.mp3	he rose and walked up and down the room speaking low words of self reproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but few
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2805.mp3	margaret i return to the old sad burden we must leave helstone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2806.mp3	yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2807.mp3	i have written to the bishop i dare say i have told you so but i forget things just now said mister hale collapsing into his depressed manner as soon as he came to talk of hard matter of fact details informing him of my intention to resign this vicarage
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2808.mp3	they are but what i have tried upon myself without avail
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2809.mp3	that will be a trial but worse far worse will be the parting from my dear people
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2810.mp3	he will come to stay with us to morrow
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2811.mp3	was it to be so sudden then
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2812.mp3	what does mamma say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2813.mp3	margaret i am a poor coward after all i cannot bear to give pain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2814.mp3	yes indeed she must said margaret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2815.mp3	perhaps after all she may not oh yes
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2816.mp3	she will she must be shocked' as the force of the blow returned upon herself in trying to realise how another would take it
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2817.mp3	to milton northern he answered with a dull indifference for he had perceived that although his daughter's love had made her cling to him and for a moment strive to soothe him with her love yet the keenness of the pain was as fresh as ever in her mind
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2818.mp3	milton northern
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2819.mp3	yes said he in the same despondent indifferent way
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2820.mp3	but he with his quick intuitive sympathy read in her face as in a mirror the reflections of his own moody depression and turned it off with an effort
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2821.mp3	you shall be told all margaret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2822.mp3	only help me to tell your mother

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2825.mp3	margaret did dislike it did shrink from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2826.mp3	mister hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of gratitude
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2827.mp3	margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2828.mp3	to turn her thoughts she said now tell me papa what our plans are
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2829.mp3	you and mamma have some money independent of the income from the living have not you aunt shaw has i know

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2832.mp3	frederick must not suffer said margaret decidedly in a foreign country so unjustly treated by his own a hundred is left
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2833.mp3	no
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2834.mp3	said mister hale that would not answer i must do something
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2835.mp3	i can always decide better by myself and not influenced by those whom i love said he as a half apology for having arranged so much before he had told any one of his family of his intentions
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2836.mp3	i cannot stand objections
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2837.mp3	they make me so undecided
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2838.mp3	mister hale continued a few months ago when my misery of doubt became more than i could bear without speaking i wrote to mister bell you remember mister bell margaret
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2839.mp3	no i never saw him i think
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2840.mp3	at any rate he has property there which has very much increased in value since milton has become such a large manufacturing town
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2841.mp3	i don't know that he gave me much strength
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2842.mp3	a private tutor
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2843.mp3	said margaret looking scornful what in the world do manufacturers want with the classics or literature or the accomplishments of a gentleman
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2844.mp3	oh said her father some of them really seem to be fine fellows conscious of their own deficiencies which is more than many a man at oxford is
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2845.mp3	some want their children to be better instructed than they themselves have been
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2846.mp3	and in milton margaret i shall find a busy life if not a happy one and people and scenes so different that i shall never be reminded of helstone
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2847.mp3	discordant as it was with almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the north of england the manufacturers the people the wild and bleak country there was this one recommendation it would be different from helstone and could never remind them of that beloved place
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2848.mp3	when do we go
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2849.mp3	i do not know exactly

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2851.mp3	you see your mother knows nothing about it yet but i think in a fortnight after my deed of resignation is sent in i shall have no right to remain
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2852.mp3	margaret was almost stunned
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2853.mp3	but she recovered herself immediately
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2854.mp3	yes papa it had better be fixed soon and decidedly as you say
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2855.mp3	poor poor maria

https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2859.mp3	he looked at her in the same steady stony manner for some moments after he had done speaking
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2860.mp3	the blessing of god be upon thee my child
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2861.mp3	the next moment she feared lest this answer to his blessing might be irreverent wrong might hurt him as coming from his daughter and she threw her arms round his neck
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2862.mp3	she heard him murmur to himself the martyrs and confessors had even more pain to bear i will not shrink
https://tlk.s3.yandex.net/annotation_tasks/librispeech/dev-other/2863.mp3	they were startled by hearing missus hale inquiring for her daughter
