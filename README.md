# About

This repository provides data and code for [*"CrowdSpeech and Vox DIY: Benchmark Dataset for Crowdsourced Audio Transcription"*](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3_hgF1NAXU7) paper.

The collected transcriptions stored in `data/*-crowd.tsv`, ground-truth transcriptions stored in `data/*-gt.txt`. We also provide a code for the annotation process 
and speech synthesis in `annotation` and `speech_sythesis` folders, respectively.


# Data

**CrowdSpeech** and **VoxDIY** datasets stored in the `data` folder. Each dataset is associated with two filed: `<dataset>-<split>-crowd.tsv` and `<dataset>-<split>-gt.txt`. The first one contains three columns `INPUT:audio` — an audio file given to crowd workers, `OUTPUT:transcription` — worker's transcription and `ASSIGNMENT:worker_id` — a unique worker identifier. The second file contains two tab-separated columns without header: an audio file and the ground-truth transcription. 

You can also download the CrowdSpeech dataset from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/toloka/CrowdSpeech).

# Evaluation
First, you may need to install some dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install crowd-kit toloka-kit jiwer
```

Then, you can easily evaluate all our baseline aggregation methods by a single command:
```bash
python3 baselines.py data/<dataset>-gt.txt data/<dataset>-crowd.tsv
```

In order to get the **Oracle** result, run
```bash
python3 oracle.py data/<dataset>-gt.txt data/<dataset>-crowd.tsv
```

You can also get the *Inter-Rater Agreement* by running
```bash
python3 agreement.py data/<dataset>-crowd.tsv
```

# VoxDIY

You can find an IPython notebook with a code for the data collection process for the **VoxDIY**. For the quality control, we use a special class, `TaskProcessor`, that
gets all the submits that are not accepted or rejected at the moment, calculates workers' skills, and checks if a submit should be accepted or rejected.

# T5 Model

Our data is also [available](https://huggingface.co/datasets/toloka/CrowdSpeech) at HuggingFace Hub as well as the [T5 model](https://huggingface.co/toloka/t5-large-for-text-aggregation) trained on `train-clean`, `dev-clean` and `dev-other` parts of **CrowdSpeech**.
