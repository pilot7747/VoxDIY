<h2>Your goal</h2>
Transcribe recordings of English speech into text.

<h2>Transcription rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All recordings have a clearly identifiable speaker -- you need to transcribe their speech only. If there is some background speech, ignore it.</li>
  <li>Your transcription must use only letters and apostrophes ('). <font class='emphasis'>Do not</font> use digits and any punctuation marks (including the question mark &#34;?&#34;) except the apostrophe.</li>
</ul>

<font class='orange' size='+1'>Important Details:</font>
<ol>
    <li>If you hear a number, spell it out in words (e.g., 19 -> nineteen).</li>
    <li>Even when the grammar rules and speaker's intonation suggest the punctuation mark, <font class='bolded'>omit it</font> (except the apostrophe). We need to obtain texts without punctuation marks.</li>
    <li>Use the apostrophe according to the grammar rules:
        <ul>
            <li>To show omissions of letters (e.g., constructions like I'm, don't, shouldn't).<br>
                <font class='emphasis'>Importantly</font>: listen carefully to what the speaker says. If they use a full form (e.g., do not), you must also write the full form. If they use a shortform (e.g., I'm), you should also write the short form. </li>
            <li>To show possession (e.g., Ivan's pen)</li>
            <li>To form plurals of letters/abbreviations etc. (e.g., She got two A's in the biology exam)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
</ol>


<h2>Pipeline</h2>
Follow a simple pipeline to perform the task:

<ol>
    <li> <u>Play the audio and carefully listen to the speech</u><br><br>
        <font class='emphasis'>Important:</font> You <font class='bolded'>must</font> listen to the complete audio record to submit your response.<br><br>
        <font class='orange'>Technical Difficulties:</font>: If the audio does not play, or there is no voice in the recording, or any other technical difficulty arises, answer &#34;No&#34; to the &#34;Does the audio play properly?&#34; question and proceed to the next task (skip all steps below).<br><br>
        <font class='green'>Hint:</font> It is best to use headphones to perform this task -- you will hear the speech better.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li> <u>Transcribe the audio and type the transcription into the text field</u><br><br>
        <font class='emphasis'>Important:</font> You <font class='bolded'>must</font> follow the transcription rules outlined above.<br><br>
        <font class='green'>Hint:</font> You can play the audio multiple times and pause it at any point. Please do your best to produce a high-quality transcription. <br><br>
    </li>
    <li> <u>Carefully check your transcription for typos and mistakes</u><br><br>
        <font class='emphasis'>Important:</font> Speech in the recordings should be grammatically correct. But if you are sure that the speaker makes a mistake, do not fix it. Your goal is to provide accurate transcriptions.<br><br>
        <font class='green'>Hint:</font> Listen to the audio in full one more time to double-check your transcription.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Exam</h2>
To start working on the main task, you have to pass a qualification exam. In the exam, you need to transcribe 10 audios and you will be accepted to the main task if the quality of your transcriptions is high enough.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<font class='bolded'> Q:</font> Do I get paid for the tasks I had technical difficulties with?<br>
<font class='bolded'> A:</font> Unfortunately, no. We will reject these tasks, but it won't hurt your status or payment for other tasks.<br><br>

<font class='bolded'> Q:</font> I have technical difficulties with all audios; what to do?<br>
<font class='bolded'> A:</font> Try to use another browser (we recommend Google Chrome). If the problem persists, let us know, and we will try to work it out with you.<br><br>

<font class='bolded'> Q:</font> I do not understand some words in the audio; what to do?<br>
<font class='bolded'> A:</font> Some audios are hard to transcribe, and it is ok. Listen to it once more and write your best guess if you do not know for sure.<br><br>

<font class='bolded'> Q:</font> When will I get paid?<br>
<font class='bolded'> A:</font> We try to review the tasks within several hours, but occasionally it may take up to a day.<br><br>

<font class='bolded'> Q:</font> All my tasks are rejected. Why?<br>
<font class='bolded'> A:</font> We have some spam detection rules in place and reject users who spam. Additionally, we have some ground truth transcriptions and may block a worker if they consistently supply clearly inadequate transcriptions. If you believe that we made a mistake, shoot us a note.<br><br>
